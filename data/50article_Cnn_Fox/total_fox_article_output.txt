President Trump used part of his CPAC speech on Saturday to criticize former Vice President Joe Biden's mental acuity ,  joking that he wouldn't be able to handle being president if he won in November . 
  " How could you be easier to beat than Joe ?  The guy can't put two sentences together ,  "  Trump told a crowd of conservatives . 
 He added that Biden's  " not going to be running the government . 
 He's just going to be sitting in a home someplace and people are going to be running it for him . 
 "  Trump warned that while Biden was moderate compared to Sen . 
 Bernie Sanders ,  I - Vt . 
 ,  the former vice president's team would be made up of  " radical left socialists . 
 "  Trump's comments came after a week of Biden making several gaffes  -  -  including when he claimed the country saw 150 million gun deaths since 2007 . 
 Trump argued that Biden got easy media coverage compared to what he would have faced if he said something like that . 
 He and First Lady Melania Trump were watching Tuesday's Democratic debate where Biden made that comment . 
  " If I would have said that ,  it would have been over . 
 You know ,  it only takes one little phrase for me ,  like a little couple of words . 
 If you mispronounce a word ,  you know with all I speak ,  they say if you pronounce the word 'the . 
' 'The ! ' 'He said  " the ,  " ' "  Trump said ,  apparently mocking the media . 
  " If you mispronounce the ,  'There's something going on . 
' "   " Here's a guy said they killed 150 million people with guns and nobody even talks about it ,  "  he added . 
 Biden's campaign reportedly clarified that he meant 150 , 000 . 
 Trump's comments came as South Carolina held its Democratic primary . 
 While campaigning in the state ,  Biden said was running for the US Senate and vowed to appoint the 'first African American woman "  to the Senate  -  -  both of which were false claims . 
 Earlier in the campaign season ,  Biden appeared to fabricate a war story ,  inaccurately stated the decade when Robert F . 
 Kenndy and Martin Luther King Jr . 
 were assassinated ,  said he preferred  " truth over facts ,  "  and misidentified New Hampshire as Vermont while campaigning in the early primary state . 
 During his CPAC speech ,  Trump also mocked Biden for mixing up locations . 
 He suggested that the former vice president should write down the state he's in when speaking . 
 On Saturday ,  Biden's campaign responded by predicting Trump would be ranting on Twitter while Biden restores decency to the White House . 
  " A year from now ,  Joe Biden will have brought character ,  honor ,  and decency back to the White House ,  "  spokesman Andrew Bates said . 
  " He'll be rebuilding the American middle class ,  fighting to give every American healthcare  -  -  instead of trying to cost millions their coverage  -  -  rallying the world against climate change ,  and reversing Donald Trump's repugnant and un - American immigration policies . 
 Donald Trump ,  on the other hand ,  will be ranting on Twitter about how Deutsche Bank is refusing to give him a loan for 'Trump Tower Moscow :  The Second Try . 
 �  �  Former Vice President Joe Biden is projected to win the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary ,  claiming his first victory of the 2020 race in what amounts to a crucial boost for his struggling campaign ahead of Super Tuesday . 
 Fox News projects that Biden will win the state � s primary decisively ,  reflecting earlier polls indicating he had a significant lead over Sen . 
 Bernie Sanders  -  -  buoyed by his support among African - American voters . 
 Sanders is currently in second place in the Palmetto State ,  ahead of billionaire Tom Steyer . 
 Behind him are former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg ,  Sen . Elizabeth Warren ,  D - Mass . ,  Sen . Amy Klobuchar ,  D - Minn . ,  and Rep . Tulsi Gabbard ,  D - Hawaii . 
 The win could help Biden reset the race after Sanders racked up victories in New Hampshire and Nevada and essentially tied the Iowa caucuses with Buttigieg . 
 The performance had led to speculation that Sanders may soon be unstoppable on his path to the Democratic nomination ,  as well as questions over whether Biden could resurrect his campaign after the former front - runner failed to win any of the first three states on the calendar . 
 But Biden ,  who has sought to present himself as the moderate best positioned to beat President Trump in November ,  was hoping that he could get back on the board in southern states with higher numbers of black voters . 
 Iowa and New Hampshire are both whiter states than the US as a whole ,  while Nevada showed Sanders' strength with Hispanic voters . 
 A Fox News voter analysis found that Biden was the highest rated by voters on who could best handle race issues . 
 He got 33 percent compared with Sanders' 21 percent . 
 Biden also did well with voters over the age of 45 ,  with 47 percent picking Biden ,  compared with 18 percent for Steyer and 14 percent for Sanders . 
 Late deciders also went big for Biden ,  the analysis found ,  with 38 percent breaking for Biden ,  with only 19 percent going for Sanders . 
 Trump used Biden's win to mock former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ,  who is sitting out the early contests but spending astonishing sums on ads in a bid to dominate Super Tuesday . 
  " Sleepy Joe Biden � s victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg � s Joke of a campaign . 
 After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates ,  Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters ,  taking many away !  "  he tweeted . 
 The former vice president told reporters on Saturday morning that he's  " optimistic not just about today "  but about  " the whole process from here on out . 
 "  And Biden predicted that  " the bigger the win "  in South Carolina ,   " the bigger the bump "  he'll get going into the 14 Super Tuesday states that hold contests in three days . 
 Biden predicted that a strong win in South Carolina will  " put me in a position to do well in North Carolina and Alabama and other states that I think in the Democratic primary I can do very well . 
 "   " I don't think it'll even be over after Super Tuesday . 
 I think it's so it can go on to states that are ones I feel very good about ,  "  he emphasized . 
 Polls had suggested Biden should win the contest ,  but some of those polls had shown a narrower lead and prompted Sanders supporters to hope that he could snatch it . 
 The Sanders surge has scared party moderates ,  who fear that the far - left candidate could hand Trump the presidency as well as Republican control of the House and Senate . 
 Sanders has sought to push back on the narrative that he is unelectable ,  pointing to polls that he says show him beating Trump in November . 
  " Take a look at the last 60 national polls that have been done ,  "  Sanders told a crowd in Columbia ,  South Carolina on Friday . 
  " Bernie beats Trump 56 out of the 60 times . 
 Take a look at some of the polls in the battleground states like Pennsylvania ,  Wisconsin ,  Michigan  -  -  Bernie beats Trump . 
 �  Other candidates ,  such as Buttigieg and Klobuchar are looking ahead to Super Tuesday already and keeping expectations low for Saturday  -  -  with a Buttigieg campaign aide telling Fox News that they're looking for a fourth -  or fifth - place finish . 
 But Steyer is hoping for a strong showing in South Carolina ,  with polls placing him in third place behind Biden and Sanders . 
 Steyer told Fox News on Friday how he viewed his chances . 
  " We have a very good team here . 
 I � ve spent a lot of time on the ground and I � m talking straightforwardly about issues ,  "  he said . 
  " This is a heavily African - American state . 
 I talk very straightforwardly about race . 
 I � m the only person talking about reparations for slavery . 
 I think I � ve been here the most and looked most people in the eye and talked most straightforwardly and I think that � s why . 
 �  Biden ,  meanwhile ,  emphasized the importance of the primary in a message to supporters at a rally in Spartanburg . 
  � This state lifted Barack Obama to the presidency ,  "  Biden said . 
  " And now once again this state holds in its hands ,  literally ,  especially the state � s African American community ,  the power to determine �  who the next nominee of the Democratic Party � s going to be �   " You hold in your hand the future of the Democratic Party ,  "  he added . 
 NATIONAL HARBOR ,  Md . 
  -  -  Mitt Romney was widely labeled as a  � political opportunist �  in this year � s Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll � despite being picked in the same straw poll as conservatives' preferred presidential nominee in 2012 . 
 The results underscored how Romney has angered some in the base for defecting on the final impeachment vote for President Trump . 
 As per tradition ,  the conservative conference included a straw poll ,  which asked attendees to assess the president � s performance ,  share their feelings on administration policies � such as the economy and immigration reform � and give predictions for the 2020 election . 
 The Romney straw poll question gave attendees three choices regarding their opinion of the 2012 presidential nominee and current Utah GOP senator . 
 The options were :   � While I may disagree with him sometimes ,  Mitt Romney is a man of principle and an important voice in the Republican Party ;  �   � Mitt Romney is a typical political opportunist by voting with Democrats to remove President Trump from office and I do not support him ,  �  or  � Unsure . 
 �  A full 78 percent of CPAC attendees chose option two � calling the Utah senator an  � opportunist �  whom they do not support . 
 CPAC � s Romney verdict is a stunning reversal from 2012 ,  when the majority of attendees gave him an unofficial endorsement � breaking a two - year winning streak by Ron Paul . 
 The vote comes after Romney ,  R - Utah ,  broke party ranks earlier this month ,  voting in favor of finding Trump guilty of abuse of power in the Senate � s impeachment trial . 
 Romney ,  though stuck with Republican senators in voting to acquit Trump on the second article of impeachment � obstruction of Congress . 
  � The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust ,  �  an emotional Romney said in an interview with Fox News �  Chris Wallace before the impeachment vote . 
  � What he did was not perfect . 
 No ,  it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights ,  our national security and our fundamental values . 
 "  Trump ,  in his impeachment trial ,  was accused of withholding aid to Ukraine as leverage to pressure the country to launch an investigation involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his family � s dealings there . 
 Democrats alleged he abused his power to investigate a political rival ,  considering Biden � s 2020 presidential bid . 
 Trump denied any quid pro quo and repeatedly described his conversations with Ukraine � s president as  � perfect . 
 �  Trump ,  during his CPAC speech Saturday ,  railed against Romney ,  calling him a  " low life . 
 "  NATIONAL HARBOR ,  Md . 
 � Attendees at this year � s Conservative Political Action Conference ,  in their annual straw poll ,  rated Bernie Sanders as the biggest threat to President Trump � s re - election . 
 As per tradition ,  the premier conservative conference included a straw poll ,  which asked attendees to assess the president's performance ,  share their feelings on administration policies -  - such as the economy and immigration reform -  - and give predictions for the 2020 election . 
 CPAC attendees gave the president a 95 percent approval rating  -  -  an all - time high at CPAC . 
 Thirty - four percent of attendees ,  meanwhile ,  ranked self - described democratic socialist Sen . 
 Bernie Sanders ,  I - Vt . 
 ,  the current front - runner in the crowded Democratic field ,  as the toughest for Trump to beat in November ,  with 23 percent of CPAC attendees saying former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg would be the toughest ,  and 9 percent picking former Vice President Joe Biden . 
 Just  .2 percent of CPAC attendees ranked Tom Steyer as the biggest threat ,  and 2 percent picked Sen . 
 Elizabeth Warren ,  D - Mass . 
 The straw poll took place on the final day of CPAC � which also is the day of the South Carolina Democratic primary . 
 Sanders has nearly swept the early contests thus far ,  with a virtual tie in the Iowa caucuses ,  a win in the New Hampshire primary ,  and a win in the Nevada Caucuses last weekend . 
 Should Sanders have the chance to claim victory in Saturday � s South Carolina primary ,  it would intensify his momentum leading into Super Tuesday on March 3 . 
 But Biden has led going into Saturday's contest . 
 President Trump ,  during his CPAC speech ,  took a  � poll �  of the audience that seemed to give a different sense of the 2020 field ,  however . 
 He asked them to  " scream like hell "  for the candidate  " you think I should run against . 
in other words ,  because we � re going to beat him ,  "  giving the audience the choice between Sanders and Biden . 
 CPAC attendees screamed louder for Sanders ,  giving a standing ovation . 
  " Joe � s not going to be running the government  -  -  he � s going to be sitting in a home somewhere ,  �  Trump ,  73 ,  remarked after the poll ,  but noted in his speech that he predicted Biden ,  who is 77 ,  would  " have a big win "  in Saturday's South Carolina primary . 
 In the straw poll ,  80 percent of CPAC attendees also said their life had improved since Trump took office ;  with 84 percent of CPAC attendees saying they feel  " safer . 
 "  Ninety - seven percent of CPAC attendees said that Democrats were  " wrong "  in impeaching Trump ,  while 77 percent of CPAC attendees also said they wanted Republicans to do  " more to support Trump . 
 "  President Trump on Saturday delighted supporters at the Conservative Political Action Conference  ( CPAC )  by crouching behind a podium as he mocked billionaire Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg's performance at a recent debate . 
  � He didn � t know what hit him ,  he � s going :   � Oh get me off this stage ,  get me off , ' "  he said ,  imitating Bloomberg ,  whom he has nicknamed  � mini Mike �  in reference to the presidential hopeful � s diminutive stature . 
 Trump then shrunk behind the podium ,  leading to sustained laughter and applause from the conservative audience . 
  � We hit a nerve there ,  huh ?  �  he added as the laughs continued . 
 Trump has long mocked Bloomberg's height ,  and alleged that he stands on a box behind podiums when speaking  -  -  something Bloomberg's team has denied . 
 Bloomberg had struggled at the debate this month in Las Vegas ,  where Sen . 
 Elizabeth Warren ,  D - Mass . 
 ,  ripped into him for treatment of women and his controversial policing practice of  " stop and frisk "  during his tenure as New York City � s mayor . 
 Trump apparently enjoyed Bloomberg � s performance ,  as the candidate spends record amounts of his own money ahead of Super Tuesday . 
  � We got mini Mike but I think he � s out of it ,  �  Trump said earlier . 
  � How � d you like to spend  $ 700 million and end up with nothing ?  Mini Mike . 
 I know him well ,  that was probably the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates . 
 �  Trump went on to muse about the fellow New Yorker � s chances going forward ,  but predicting it won � t work out for him . 
  � But he � s going to keep spending the money ,  I hear his ads stop on Tuesday ,  �  he said . 
  � It just shows you can � t buy an election ,  there � s a point at which people say  � you gotta bring the goods a little bit too ,  you gotta bring the goods . 
 �  �  COLUMBIA ,  SC . 
  -  -  The top two South Carolina Democratic Party officials say turnout in Saturday � s presidential primary will be  � substantially higher �  than their original estimate and will probably approach the record high set in 2008 . 
  � I think it � s going to be higher than I originally anticipated ,  �  state party Chairman Trav Robertson told Fox News during a news conference with reporters in Columbia on Saturday . 
  � I originally thought you � d see somewhere between 289 , 000 and 350 , 000 . 
 I think it � s going to be substantially higher than that ,  �  he said . 
 Executive director Jay Parmley told reporters  � we � ve very confident we � ll exceed 2016 numbers and probably approaching the high ,  which was 2008 . 
 �  Roughly 370 , 000 people voted in the 2016 primary ,  when eventual nominee Hillary Clinton trounced Sen . 
 Bernie Sanders of Vermont by a nearly three - to - one margin . 
 A record 532 , 000 voted in the 2008 Democratic primary ,  when then - Sen . 
 Barack Obama crushed then - Sen . 
 Clinton by 30 points ,  with John Edwards in third place . 
 Asked by Fox News which candidates this likely surge in turnout will help ,  Robertson didn � t directly answer ,  instead saying  � that depends on which candidates got their team on the ground doing GOTV . 
 This is all about the campaigns turning out their voters ,  those yeses ,  and those undecideds they � ve convinced . 
 �  The expected boost in turnout is partially due to an increase in absentee ballots already cast . 
 Citing new figures from state election officials  ( the presidential primary in South Carolina � s conducted by the state )  ,  Robertson said  � we � re right under 80 , 000 absentee ballots cast . 
 That is a significant increase from 2016 as well as 2018 . 
 That � s up 28 , 000 - 30 , 000 ballots from 2016 . 
  �  In the past ,  absentee balloting has always been an early indicator of what turnout is going to be in South Carolina . 
 �  And pointing to the large role black voters play in the state � s Democratic presidential primary ,  he noted that  � we anticipate that a significant number of non - white voters will make up anywhere from 55 to 62 - 63 percent of the electorate . 
  � We think that will play a significant role in today � s turnout . 
 ,  �  Robertson said . 
 Earlier this month a new record high turnout was recorded in New Hampshire's Democratic presidential primary . 
 Parmley addressed what � s being dubbed Operation Chaos 2020 ,  a move by some South Carolina conservative activists who are urging Republicans to vote in Saturday � s Democratic primary and cast a ballot for Sen . 
 Bernie Sanders as a way to help President Trump . 
 Many on the right see Sanders  �  a self - described democratic socialist  �  as a weak general election candidate to challenge Trump . 
 South Carolina has an open primary system ,  where anybody of either party or independent voters can cast a ballot in either the Democratic or Republican primaries . 
 But the Republicans in the state scrapped their presidential primary and formally backed Trump � s re - election ,  so all the action this cycle � s in the Democratic primary . 
 Parmley said  � we have not seen  -  -  at least in the absentee data  -  -  any mass evidence of Republicans infiltrating ,  if you will ,  our primary  �  which is perfectly legal . 
 Any South Carolina voter can cast a ballot today . 
 �   � Only 2 , 500 that have voted by absentee ballot have voted in multiple Republican primaries in the past ,  �  he added . 
  � We � re not seeing yet ,  this kind of widespread Republican participation . 
 "  To help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus ,  President Trump has directed the State Department to issue new travel restrictions for certain countries . 
 Here's what you need to know . 
 During a Saturday press conference at the White House ,  Vice President Mike Pence  -  -  who is leading the coronavirus response  -  -  announced a new ban on travel from Iran . 
 This would cover any foreign national who has visited the country within the last 14 days . 
 He also said Trump has authorized the State Department to raise its travel advisory to Level Four ,  which is the highest level ,  for certain areas in Italy and South Korea that have been hit hardest by the virus . 
 At the press conference Saturday ,  Trump also hinted at tightening the US . 
 - Mexico border . 
 The US had issued a travel advisory for China  -  -  the epicenter of the virus  -  -  late last month ,  warning citizens to avoid the country entirely . 
 The State Department also issued a travel warning update for Italy on Friday and urged Americans to reconsider traveling there . 
 In Italy ,  900 people have been sickened so far and 21 have died . 
  " Reconsider travel to Italy due to a recent outbreak of COVID - 19 ,  "  the advisory read . 
  " There is an ongoing outbreak of COVID - 19 caused by a novel  ( new )  coronavirus in Italy . 
 Many cases of COVID - 19 have been associated with travel to or from mainland China or close contact with a travel - related case ,  but sustained community spread has been reported in Italy . 
 "  Since the first cases of the disease were reported in December 2019 ,  at least 2 , 800 people have died and close to 85 , 000 have been infected worldwide . 
 Most of the cases ,  however ,  are in mainland China . 
 Trump called for calm on Saturday and tried to reassure the nation that the threat was under control . 
  " There's no reason to panic at all . 
 This is something that is being handled professionally ,  "  he said . 
 There are 22 patients in the United States who have coronavirus ,  Trump said . 
 One medically high - risk patient passed away overnight ,  but the remaining patients are at varying levels of recovery and were all allowed to return home . 
  " Unfortunately ,  one person passed away overnight ,  "  the president said . 
  � She was a wonderful woman ,  a medically high - risk patient in her late 50s . 
 Four others are very ill . 
 Thankfully 15 are either recovered fully or they're well on their way to recovery . 
 And in all cases ,  they've been let go in their home . 
 "  The virus is thought to have contributed to the volatility experienced by the stock market this week after the Dow plunged more than 3 , 500 points  -  -  the worst decline since the 2008 global financial crisis . 
 The president told Americans to brace for more coronavirus cases but claimed healthy individuals are likely to recover . 
 Elderly patients and those with certain underlying medical conditions are at a higher risk and must exercise vigilance and caution . 
  " Our country is prepared for any circumstance ,  "  he had said following a coronavirus task force meeting in the White House situation room . 
 Trump had blamed his Democratic detractors this past week on Twitter for  " politicizing "  the coronavirus outbreak to spread panic and took shots at the media for its constant coverage of the issue . 
 NATIONAL HARBOR ,  Md . 
  -  -  President Trump rallied the core of the conservative activist base Saturday with a fiery address mercilessly mocking his potential Democratic presidential foes ,  railing against the  � Washington swamp �  and shaming Republican Sen . 
 Mitt Romney for defecting on the final impeachment vote . 
 Closing out the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington with a speech that lasted over 90 minutes ,  Trump ripped into what he called the  " hate - filled left - wing mob . 
 "  But in the wake of impeachment and the Russia probe ,  Trump praised Republicans for sticking together . 
 He added :   " Except Romney . 
 "  The crowd at CPAC booed Romney ,  R - Utah ,  who in 2012 won the conservative conference's straw poll for the preferred GOP presidential nominee . 
 But times have changed after he voted to convict Trump on the abuse of power article approved by the House . 
  � He got some good publicity ,  �  Trump said . 
  � He � s a low life . 
 �  Trump went on to sound off on the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates in deeply personal terms ,  hitting hard against former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg ,  whom he has dubbed  � mini Mike ,  �  and Sen . 
 Elizabeth Warren ,  D - Mass . 
 ,  whom he calls  � Pocahontas �  over her ancestry controversy . 
 Going after  � mini Mike ,  �  he said of Bloomberg's debate debut ,   � That was probably the worst debate performance of any presidential debate . 
 �   � Boy ,  did Pocahontas destroy him ,  �  Trump continued ,  while diverting momentarily to mock Warren's Native American ancestry test . 
  � And look what I did to her � she went out and got a test . 
 Remember when I said I have more Indian blood in me than she does ,  and I have none . 
 Would love to have some ,  but I have none . 
 She was really mean to mini Mike ,  I � ll tell you ,  the way she treated him . 
 �  Then Trump turned to theatrics to taunt his fellow New Yorker ,  as Trump said of the diminutive ex - mayor :   � He � s going  � oh ,  get me off the stage . 
 �  �  Trump crouched behind the podium at CPAC ,  glancing over the top ,  pretending to be Bloomberg ,  whom he has repeatedly tormented over his height . 
 Trump also slammed Bloomberg for spending hundreds of millions of his personal money on his presidential race ,  saying he  " writes checks like a drunken sailor "  and has  " very bad people "  advising him . 
  " I know some of his people ,  they are ripping him off ,  they're bad people and they are laughing all the way to the bank ,  "  Trump said . 
  " 'Keep running ,  Mike . 
 Keep doing it Mike . 
' "  Trump went on to take a  " poll "  of the audience ,  asking them to  " scream like hell "  for the candidate  " you think I should run against .
in other words ,  because we � re going to beat him ,  "  giving the audience the choice between Sanders and Biden . 
 CPAC attendees screamed louder for Sanders ,  giving a standing ovation . 
  " Joe � s not going to be running the government  -  -  he � s going to be sitting in a home somewhere ,  �  Trump ,  73 ,  remarked after the poll ,  but noted in his speech that he predicted Biden ,  who is 77 ,  would  " have a big win "  in Saturday's South Carolina primary Trump also mocked Biden for his frequent campaign trail gaffes ,  including misstating the number of gun deaths in America during last week's debate . 
 Biden campaign rapid response director Andrew Bates swiped at Trump afterward ,  telling Fox News :   " A year from now ,  Joe Biden will have brought character ,  honor ,  and decency back to the White House . 
 He'll be rebuilding the American middle class ,  fighting to give every American healthcare  -  -  instead of trying to cost millions their coverage  -  -  rallying the world against climate change ,  and reversing Donald Trump's repugnant and un - American immigration policies . 
 Donald Trump ,  on the other hand ,  will be ranting on Twitter about how Deutsche Bank is refusing to give him a loan for 'Trump Tower Moscow :  The Second Try . 
' �  Trump also claimed he didn't know how  " dirty "  DC . 
 would be and  " how deep "  the swamp would be ,  as he riffed on one of his favorite campaign trail rallying cries . 
  " I never knew the swamp was so bad . 
 It's really bad ,  but we're winning ,  and we're winning not easy . 
 A lot of dirty people ,  a lot of very ,  very bad people -  - bad people ,  "  he said . 
  " I do think justice will be had . 
 Or I wouldn't be very happy right now . 
 "  The president went on to tout the military and their success in taking out ISIS founder Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi and Iranian Gen . 
 Qassem Soleimani ,  saying :   � We took that son of a b -  -  -  out . 
 �  But he also defended the administration's newly signed agreement with the Taliban as part of an effort to bring thousands of US . 
 troops home from the post -  9 / 11 Afghanistan war . 
  � But American forces cannot be the policemen for the entire world � a lot of time we � re not even appreciated ,  taken for granted ,  �  he said . 
  � We signed a deal with the Taliban so that we can hopefully begin the immediate process of finally bringing our troops back home ,  �  Trump said . 
  � 19 years � We just signed it . 
 We really have to thank the families and those incredible people who lost their lives . 
 �  Trump ,  though ,  added :   � The Taliban are great fighters . 
 They � re great fighters . 
 �  The president shifted to national security and border security ,  saying his administration has taken  � the most aggressive action to control our borders . 
 �   � We intend to keep radical Islamist terrorists the hell out of our country ,  and we � re keeping them out ,  �  Trump said . 
 The president � s address to CPAC came after he gave a press conference on coronavirus at the White House earlier in the day where he assured the nation ,  while also announcing new travel restrictions . 
 During his speech ,  he offered help to nations affected ,  like Iran ,  saying :   " All they have to do is ask . 
 "  Trump has addressed CPAC every year since taking office in 2017 . 
 The president � s speech follows days of panels ,  featuring White House officials ,  members of his re - election campaign ,  prominent Republican lawmakers and members of the conservative media making the case against socialism . 
 The theme at the annual conservative gathering outside Washington has been  " America vs . 
 Socialism . 
 "  The rhetoric at the event has repeatedly turned back to the current front - runner for the Democratic presidential nomination ,  democratic socialist Sen . 
 Bernie Sanders . 
 Vice President Mike Pence also addressed CPAC ,  warning conservatives against socialism � saying :   � Freedom works . 
 Socialism doesn � t . 
 �  Pence ,  during his CPAC appearance ,  rallied the crowd and made the case for Trump � s re - election . 
  � Elections are about choices ,  �  Pence said ,  while saying the 2020 race will give voters the choice between socialism and freedom . 
  � The choice has never been clearer ,  the stakes have never been higher ,  �  Pence said . 
  � Men and women of CPAC ,  we � ve got work to do . 
 The truth is ,  it won � t be enough to win the next election . 
 We � ve got to win the next generation . 
 �  The president � s speech comes on the day of the South Carolina primary ,  where former Vice President Joe Biden is hoping to salvage his campaign with a win in the state he's long considered his firewall . 
 Sanders has been catching up to him in the polls but has continued to trail . 
 President Trump on Saturday rejected reports that Dr . 
 Anthony Fauci  -  -  the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  -  -  was muzzled from speaking to the public about the dangers of the coronavirus . 
  � That � s a very dishonest question ,  because he has had that ability to do virtually whatever he � s wanted to do ,  �  Trump said when asked at a White House briefing if he was muzzling Fauci . 
  � He was never muzzled . 
 �  The New York Times on Thursday reported that Fauci had been instructed by the White House not to say anything else without clearance after he had said the virus had adapted well to human species and had a higher mortality rate than influenza . 
 But Trump not only denied the claim ,  but also brought up Fauci to address the reports . 
  � I have never been muzzled ever and I've been doing this since the administration of Ronald Reagan ,  I'm not being muzzled by this administration ,  "  Fauci said . 
 He said he was set up to go on TV shows ,  but when Vice President Mike Pence was appointed to lead the efforts against the global virus ,  he stood down from those appearances as they regrouped . 
 He says he then reapplied for clearance to go on the shows and was approved . 
  � So I have not been muzzled at all ,  that was a real misrepresentation of what happened ,  �  he said . 
 Trump also pushed back against criticism for referring to the coronavirus as Democrats �   � new hoax �  in a rally in South Carolina the night before . 
 Some Democrats had taken that comment as referring to the virus itself ,  but Trump clarified on Saturday that he was not calling it a hoax ,  but the politicized response to it by Democrats . 
  � No no no ,  hoax referring to the action they take to try and pin this on somebody because we � ve done such a good job ,  �  he said . 
  � The hoax is on them ,  I'm not talking about what � s happening here ,  I � m talking about what they � re doing ,  that � s the hoax . 
 �   � That's just a continuation of the hoax ,  whether it � s the impeachment hoax or the Russia Russia Russia hoax ,  this is what I � m talking about  -  - certainly not referring to this ,  how could anyone refer to this ,  this is very serious stuff ,  �  he said . 
 Debra Messing is the latest liberal to blame President Trump for the coronavirus ,  but there's one small problem with her argument :  it's based on inaccurate information ,  according to a new report . 
 The 51 - year - old actress took to Twitter on Friday in response to a Washington Post article claiming the US . 
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is poised to cut its global disease prevention efforts by 80 percent . 
  " THIS is why Trump MUST GO !  He puts Americans in mortal danger ,  "  the  " Will and Grace "  actress tweeted while sharing a link to the article . 
 However ,  the article is dated Feb . 
 1 ,  2018 ,  and Breitbart reported that the CDC statistic is old news and never happened . 
 Democratic presidential hopefuls Mike Bloomberg and Joe Biden have recently made similar erroneous claims that Trump cut funding for the CDC . 
 While Trump proposed cuts to the CDC in his budget blueprint ,  he was overruled by Congress ,  and the eventual budget he signed included an increase in funding . 
 On Wednesday ,  the president sought to minimize fears at a White House press conference in which he insisted the US . 
 is  � very ,  very ready �  for a coronavirus outbreak and predicted :   � This will end  �  there � s no reason to be panicked . 
 �  Health officials in charge of handling the outbreak ,  however ,  have predicted there will be more US cases . 
 Biden later corrected his comments ,  but went on to warn that Trump  � did not have a plan to deal with how you equip hospitals . 
 �  Bloomberg ,  meanwhile ,  criticized Trump at a Houston rally on Thursday ,  accusing him of  " burying his head in the sand "  and charging that  � his failure to prepare is crippling our ability to respond . 
 "  Trump is expected to address concerns about the virus and update plans to contain it at a press conference Saturday . 
 Michael Bloomberg's campaign will host more than 2 , 400 events across 30 states in a show of force before Super Tuesday ,  the first time the former mayor's name will appear on the ballot . 
 More than 75 Bloomberg surrogates will fan out across the country starting this weekend in a massive get out the vote effort funded by the billionaire . 
 Bloomberg himself will visit Virginia ,  North Carolina ,  Alabama and Texas before Super Tuesday . 
 Bloomberg joined the Democratic primary late and didn't compete in the first four early - voting states but instead pumped millions into ad buys and campaign infrastructure across the country . 
 Voters in 14 states will head to the polls on Tuesday in the biggest single vote haul of the campaign so far . 
  � Our team of thousands of committed volunteers and state staff are spending the days leading up to Super Tuesday connecting with voters in their towns and communities across the US . 
 ,  �  said Dan Kanninen ,  Bloomberg 2020 States Director ,  in a statement . 
  � Our unmatched organization will be in full display this weekend as we continue to build on our momentum and talk to voters about Mike � s record on critical issues like health care ,  climate change ,  and gun violence prevention ,  and why he is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump in November . 
 �  Bloomberg's campaign says it has more than 2 , 000 staffers around the country and 400 more people at the New York City headquarters . 
 Sen . Bernie Sanders ,  I - Vt . ,  has been the front - runner in the primary ,  but former Vice President Joe Biden is hoping for a comeback in Saturday's South Carolina primary that could build his momentum for Tuesday's contests . 
 President Trump authorized new travel restrictions and warnings Saturday  �  and said he � s even looking at closing the southern border  �  in response to the coronavirus outbreak that has claimed the first American life ,  while assuring the nation at an all - hands - on - deck press conference there � s  � no reason to panic . 
 �  Trump announced new strict travel  " edicts "  affecting Iran ,  Italy and South Korea and Trump confirmed he's looking to potentially tighten the US - Mexico border . 
  " Yes ,  we are thinking about  [ the ]  southern border ,  we have received a lot of power on the southern border over the last couple of years from the courts but we are looking at that very strongly ,  "  Trump said at a press conference . 
 The rare appearance in the White House press briefing room came shortly after news of the first death in the United States from the new virus and a terrible week on the stock market over fears of the outbreak . 
  " There's no reason to panic at all . 
 This is something that is being handled professionally ,  "  Trump assured ,  while also acknowledging more cases in the US . 
 are  " likely . 
 "  The president said there are 22 patients in the United States who have coronavirus . 
  " Unfortunately ,  one person passed away overnight ,  "  Trump said ,  speaking to a case in Washington state . 
  � She was a wonderful woman ,  a medically high - risk patient in her late 50s . 
 Four others are very ill . 
 Thankfully 15 are either recovered fully or they're well on their way to recovery . 
 And in all cases ,  they've been let go in their home . 
 �  After Trump spoke ,  officials in Washington state said the first US coronavirus death was actually a male . 
 Asked about the discrepancy ,  a senior administration official said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention briefed Trump earlier that the victim was a female . 
 Later ,  the CDC director took responsibility on Twitter for  " erroneously "  identifying the patient as female when briefing the president and vice president . 
 Trump also said Saturday that most healthy people would be able to pull through should they contract coronavirus :   " Additional cases in the United States are likely . 
 But healthy individuals should be able to fully recover . 
 �  Trump praised the response so far and said the United States has secured 43 million masks already . 
 He said he's meeting with pharmaceutical company leaders on Monday at the White House to discuss vaccine development . 
  " Our country is prepared for any circumstance ,  "  Trump said Saturday after Vice President Pence led a coronavirus task force meeting in the Situation Room . 
 Pence ,  tapped to lead the virus response ,  also announced the new travel restrictions ,  including an expanded ban on travel from Iran . 
 This would cover any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days . 
 He also said Trump has authorized the State Department to raise the travel advisory for certain affected areas to Level Four ,  the highest level  �  so that Americans will be urged not to travel to areas in Italy and South Korea most affected by the virus . 
 Trump already signed an order Jan . 
 31 barring entry to foreign nationals ,  other than immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents ,  who visited China within the last 14 days ,  which scientists say is the virus � s longest incubation period . 
 The State Department also has a Level Four alert for Americans to not travel to China ,  where the outbreak originated . 
 It's unclear whether more restrictions will come for the southern border . 
 Officials in Ecuador on Saturday confirmed the first case of the new coronavirus in the South American nation and Mexico reported two more to raise the country's total to four . 
 Mexican health officials said the country is not currently facing a national emergency over the virus ,  while confirming the cases in Mexico City and in the northwestern state of Sinaloa . 
 Pence also advised against stockpiling on masks . 
  � The average American does not need to go out and buy a mask ,  �  he said . 
 It � s the second time this week Trump spoke to reporters in a rare White House briefing room press conference ,  signaling the seriousness the administration is placing on the coronavirus that has now infected more than 85 , 000 worldwide and killed 2 , 900 . 
 The closures and quarantines around the world have spooked investors and the stock market took a dramatic tumble this week . 
 News of the latest death comes on the heels of three new cases in California ,  Oregon and Washington in which the patients were infected by unknown means . 
 They had not recently traveled overseas or had come into contact with anyone who had . 
 As new cases have popped up in the United States ,  tensions between Trump and Democrats are bubbling up as well . 
 At a rally in South Carolina Friday night ,  Trump accused his Democratic critics of  " politicizing "  the coronavirus outbreak and dismissed the criticism about his handling of the virus as  � their new hoax �  and insisted  � we are totally prepared . 
 �  Meanwhile ,  the House held a bipartisan briefing with health officials Friday morning ,  leaving Democrats questioning whether Trump has a handle on the response . 
 Democratic Rep . 
 Adam Schiff ,  who led the impeachment fight ,  said Friday he has  " profound concerns "  about Trump's response to the coronavirus and cast doubt on whether the White House is telling the truth to the American public about the global outbreak . 
  " The president and vice president don � t inspire confidence ,  "  Schiff told Fox News as he left a coronavirus briefing at the Capitol Friday morning . 
  " And because the president has made so many false statements about so many things ,  you can't really rely on the White House . 
 "  Schiff's comments come after Trump blasted Democrats in a tweetstorm for playing politics with the coronavirus threat . 
  " I have profound concerns about the management of this at the level of the White House ,  "  Schiff said ,   " but there are some good career people who we got the opportunity to talk to today . 
 �  Trump was joined by Pence and top health officials ,  including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar ,  Dr . 
 Anthony Fauci ,  the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ,  Surgeon General Jerome Adams and CDC Director Robert Redfield . 
 Health officials in Washington confirmed Saturday that one person has died from coronavirus ,  marking the first disease - related death in the US . 
 Seattle and King County Public Health officials issued a vague media advisory announcing the first COVID - 19 death in the US ,  adding that there was an undisclosed number of new cases as well . 
 News of the death comes on the heels of three new cases in California ,  Oregon and Washington in which the patients were infected by unknown means . 
 They had not recently traveled overseas or had come into contact with anyone who had . 
 President Donald Trump said during a press conference Saturday that 22 people in the US have been stricken by the new coronavirus and that additional cases are  " likely . 
 "   " Unfortunately ,  one person passed away overnight ,  "  Trump said . 
  � She was a wonderful woman a medically high - risk patient in her late 50s . 
 Four others are very ill . 
 Thankfully 15 are either recovered fully or they're well on their way to recovery . 
 And in all cases ,  they've been let go in their home . 
 He said :   " Additional cases in the United States are likely . 
 But healthy individuals should be able to fully recover . 
 �  The number of COVID - 19 cases in the United States is considered small . 
 Worldwide ,  the number of people sickened by the virus hovered Friday around 83 , 000 ,  and there were more than 2 , 800 deaths ,  most of them in China . 
 The new COVID - 19 cases of unknown origins mark an escalation of the worldwide outbreak in the US because it means the virus could spread beyond the reach of preventative measures like quarantines ,  though state health officials said that was inevitable and that the risk of widespread transmission remains low . 
 As new cases have popped up in the United States ,  COVID - 19 has become a polarizing point of contention between Democrats and the White House . 
 At a rally in South Carolina Friday night ,  Trump accused his Democratic critics of  " politicizing "  the coronavirus outbreak and dismissed the criticism about his handling of the virus as  � their new hoax �  and insisted  � we are totally prepared . 
 �  Health officials in Washington state are expected to hold a press conference late Saturday afternoon where they are expected to offer more information on the patient � s death and the new confirmed cases . 
 The United States signed a peace deal with the Taliban in Qatar Saturday . 
 If conditions in Afghanistan stay at their current level of decreased violence ,  we will begin returning most of our troops from the longest war in our history . 
 The deal itself has numerous conditions that the Taliban must meet including severing all ties with terrorist organizations and negotiating in good faith with the Afghan government toward a lasting agreement . 
 The withdrawal of some US troops ,  as well as prisoner swaps that will release up to 5 , 000 Taliban prisoners ,  are part of the initial confidence - building measures . 
 This was the right decision by President Trump from an array of not very good options . 
 And that is what a good leader does ,  makes a tough but smart call when it would be easier to simply maintain the status quo . 
 No one ,  including our negotiators ,  expects the Taliban to be honorable in abiding by this agreement . 
 Their nature and history have shown they will act ruthlessly in their own interests . 
 Nothing can be achieved without significant pressures placed on them and even more significant repercussions for malfeasance . 
 But we have not been able to impose our will on them using military force ,  so we must acknowledge that and move on . 
 That � s the thing about war . 
 We can make all the plans and strategies we want ,  but the enemy and reality get a vote too . 
 Almost twenty years of US blood and treasure had not taken us to a victory any more lasting than when we first deposed the Taliban at the end of 2001 . 
 They ruled Afghanistan then as tyrannical theocrats and had given safe haven to Al Qaeda who planned and executed the 9 / 11 attacks from there . 
 We had to make a strong response and we did . 
 In a few short months ,  Special Forces teams partnered with indigenous militias and defeated the Taliban . 
 But then we went wrong . 
 The decision to stay and try to make Afghanistan a more stable and peaceful place that also presents less potential danger to us is easy to understand . 
 But it was fundamentally flawed and at odds with the long history of that country . 
 The hellish terrain and tribal nature of the country made all previous attempts to impose order on it short - lived and painful for any outsiders involved . 
 We can now join Alexander the Great ,  the British Empire ,  the Soviet Union and a host of others in not achieving this . 
 One of the main rationales for staying was that if we left we would allow another Al Qaeda to rise that could threaten us from a mountain retreat . 
 This is a legitimate fear as it has already happened . 
 But we are aware of that and while keeping a seemingly permanent force there is one way to try and avoid this ,  there are other ways to achieve this goal . 
 Earlier this month in an op - ed for Fox News Opinion I wrote about a proposed one - sided withdrawal statement telling the Taliban and others what lines must not be crossed :  No terrorist bases in Afghanistan . 
 No safe passage ,  safe haven or any other support for terrorist groups . 
 No attacks on US personnel or interests . 
 I suggested the statement could also say ,   � We believe it would be better if you created a society that was not oppressive ,  brutal and often barbaric ;  but we are not the world � s policeman or domestic violence shelter . 
 We will offer a hand of friendship and aid to those trying to make Afghanistan a better place . 
 We will bring a rain of hellfire and damnation down on any who violate these demands . 
 �  I think as a backstop to the peace deal ,  all of these factors that I laid out in the op - ed are still applicable . 
 There are many things we would like to see in Afghanistan ,  but they do not rise to the level of US strategic interests . 
 We put considerable effort into raising the status and quality of life for women there and gains have been made . 
 There are concerns these will be eroded and if that happens it will be a significant loss . 
 But if that is the standard ,  then there are dozens of countries around the world where we could make an equal case for intervention . 
 We must choose our foreign entanglements wisely as George Washington noted in his farewell address :   � I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs ,  that honesty is always the best policy . 
 I repeat it ,  therefore ,  let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense . 
 But ,  in my opinion ,  it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them . 
 �  His point was that occasionally US interests require alliances or actions abroad ,  but these should always be weighed against the tendency for them to draw us away from what truly matters to this country . 
 Afghanistan itself does not . 
 Terrorist safe havens there would . 
 We should take the least entangling path to safeguard ourselves from that possibility . 
 This initial agreement begins the disentanglement process and that seems the best path for us . 
 We can always return to military action if an actual rather than potential danger emerges . 
 Former National Security Adviser John Bolton attacked his former boss's historic peace treaty with the Taliban ,  arguing it posed an  " unacceptable risk to American civilians . 
 "   " Signing this agreement with Taliban is an unacceptable risk to America's civilian population ,  "  Bolton tweeted on Saturday . 
  " This is an Obama - style deal ,  "  Bolton said ,  referring to Trump's predecessor . 
  " Legitimizing Taliban sends the wrong signal to ISIS and al Qaeda terrorists ,  and to America's enemies generally . 
 "  Bolton ,  long considered a foreign policy hawk ,  left the Trump administration last fall amid disagreements over the administration's approach to Afghanistan and other countries . 
 During a press conference on Saturday ,  Trump defended himself against Bolton's criticism . 
  " He should have tried to do something better ,  "  he said of Bolton . 
  " He was here for a year . 
 He could have done something better  -  -  I was all ears ,  and he wasn't able to do that . 
 "  He also criticized Bolton for his role in pushing conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
  " He was very much in favor of going in . 
 We should have never gone in in the first place  .  
 when they went into Iraq ,  when they went into the Middle East in such a fashion ,  I was very much against it ,  shouldn't have gone in . 
 He thought we should have  -  -  that's been proven wrong . 
 "  Saturday's agreement is aimed at ending the 18 - year armed conflict that started when Bolton served as an adviser in former President George W . 
 Bush's administration . 
 As part of the agreement ,  the US is drawing back a number of the approximately 13 , 000 troops stationed there ,  although more than 8 , 000 will remain to ensure certain counter - terrorism conditions are met by the Taliban . 
 Another condition of the agreement calls for the release of 5 , 000 Taliban members from Afghan - run jails ,  although it was not clear if the Afghan government will comply with that . 
 A senior administration official told reporters earlier this week that the deal  " explicitly mentions al Qaeda "  and calls for the Taliban to cut all ties . 
 The US is also working for a  " complete ceasefire "  which will be discussed in Oslo on March 10 . 
 Bolton's comments were just the latest salvo in an on - going feud between President Trump and his hawkish former adviser . 
 Many saw his place in the administration as a departure from the anti - war tone Trump set during his 2016 campaign . 
 Amid news Bolton was planning to publish a book ,  Trump ridiculed him on Twitter . 
  " If I listened to him ,  we would be in World War Six by now ,  "  Trump said . 
 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Taliban leaders in Doha that he would  " closely watch the Taliban � s compliance with their commitments and calibrate the pace of our withdrawal to their actions . 
 This is how we will ensure that Afghanistan never again serves as a base for international terrorists . 
 "   � This agreement will mean nothing and today � s good feelings will not last if we don � t take concrete actions on commitments and promises that have been made ,  �  Pompeo said ,  seemingly directed at his counterparts . 
 Among those in attendance were leaders of the Taliban ,  who harbored Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network as they plotted ,  and then celebrated ,  the hijackings of four airliners that were crashed into lower Manhattan ,  the Pentagon and a field in western Pennsylvania ,  killing almost 3 , 000 people . 
 President Donald Trump has demonstrated yet again his art of negotiation as the United States ,  Taliban ,  and Afghan government execute a joint declaration to solidify a reduction of violence agreement with the Taliban . 
 Following a successful seven day violence - free test period ,  the US has made a decisive move towards a negotiated peace plan in Afghanistan . 
 This is not only a good step towards ending America � s longest war but for the Taliban and Afghan government to work towards peace and stability within Afghanistan ,  too . 
 It also represents a triumph of the American blood and treasure spent in Afghanistan  �  the Taliban agreed to the same key demand that they were offered shortly after 9 - 11 ,  19 years ago :  to prevent their country from being used as a base for terrorists to launch attacks against the United States or its allies . 
 Having spent a year in Afghanistan in various combat detachments ,  this agreement is a welcome development for our warfighters ,  door - kickers and trigger - pullers . 
 This joint declaration demonstrates the US continued support for peace and notes that the Taliban will end their relationship with international terrorists and ensure Afghan soil cannot be used to threaten the US . 
 or our allies again . 
 The trial one - week reduction of violence was not a ceasefire but a step forward as the US worked towards a plan for a longer reduction in violence . 
 The US judgment of Taliban compliance with commitments will determine the pace of our condition - based withdrawal . 
 Should we see an increase in violence against the Afghan government or US troops then this will obviously slow the delay . 
 We have seen the president walk away from deals where the other party changes the terms at the last minute or does not comply with the agreement . 
 US and Taliban negotiators ,  along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signed the historic agreement Saturday in Qatar . 
 This signifies that both the US and Taliban have expressed a willingness and interest for peace in Afghanistan If successful ,  the settlements in Afghanistan will be more stable ,  restoration of all services including cell phones will be included and that will ensure communication channels with the Taliban . 
 Additionally ,  the Taliban has also committed to entering an intra - Afghan negotiation with the Afghan government ,  other political leaders ,  and civil society groups that include women . 
 This joint declaration demonstrates a strong partnership with Afghanistan and could not have been achieved without President Trump and his administration . 
 Even the Afghan government describes the US . 
 - Taliban agreement as a historic step towards ending the war and establishing national teams to participate in intra - Afghan talks . 
 Many Democrats will undoubtedly take the opportunity to attack the president ,  but they know that even former President Obama did not  ( and could not )  pull this off or achieve such as monumental deal . 
 This agreement will also see a troop reduction to around 8 , 600 troops by the 2020 elections in November ,  which also fulfills the president � s campaign promises to end America � s longest wars and return troops home safely . 
 Make no mistake however ,  this is not optics ,  it � s historic !  A political settlement is the most feasible way to establish peace after 19 years of fighting and thousands of lives lost in Afghanistan . 
 The US will still support fighting against terror groups such as Haqqani and ISIS in the country if needed but that should be dealt with primarily by the Afghan National Army . 
 This historic deal that President Trump has achieved with his top cabinet members ,  Special Envoy Amb . 
 Khalilzad and Doha � s ability to open communication channels is a historic success that will keep America safe and reduces our Afghan burden . 
 This is unprecedented development because never before has the US signed a peace agreement with the Taliban . 
 Our US diplomatic engagement with the Taliban comes after more than a year of continual negotiation and efforts . 
 The president has also received support from our NATO allies ,  the European Union ,  Russia ,  China and partners in the region . 
 Having worked in Afghanistan to support diplomatic missions across the country ,  I fully understand the historic significance of this agreement . 
 After 19 years ,  the Taliban have agreed to the same thing that the US asked them for at the beginning of this conflict ,  which was to prevent any terrorist organization to use Taliban territory to attack the United States or our allies . 
 Ever since he began his effort to buy the Democratic nomination ,  Michael Bloomberg has been attacked by all sides for the stop  &  frisk policies he used for 12 years as mayor of New York City . 
 Under those policies ,  police were encouraged to stop and question individuals on the streets of New York and then frisk them if they suspect them of committing criminal activity . 
 Bloomberg himself has apologized for all this . 
 He says he's embarrassed by the existence of the policy . 
 The Trump campaign and its many surrogates have joined him in that they've partnered with the left to call Bloomberg a racist for stop  &  frisk . 
 And that's understandable ,  of course ,  because it's election season and every politician ,  every campaign knows it's useful to attack an opponent where he's vulnerable . 
 But let's take three steps back . 
 Let's put politics aside . 
 The only problem Bloomberg has with stop  &  frisk is that he's apologizing for it . 
 Stop  &  frisk isn't racist . 
 Even as crime fell in the city ,  the most dangerous parts of New York were still filled with volatile young men ,  many of them gang members carrying illegal guns . 
 Stop  &  frisk found those guns by the thousands while gang members learned to leave their legal weapons at home if they didn't want to go to jail . 
 Stop  &  frisk also found a lot of illegal drugs and took them as well as their dealers off the streets . 
 Did most searches discover a crime ?  No ,  they didn't . 
 But 12 percent of all stop  &  frisk searches ,  the  " frisk "  part did discover a crime . 
 And that's a remarkable number for an otherwise harmless search . 
 Imagine if twelve percent of all TSA searches discovered a gun or a bomb or other criminal behavior . 
 Would you want TSA abolished as wasteful and excessive ?  No !  You wouldn't !  It would be a huge success . 
 Is stop  &  frisk racist ?  Well ,  unlike Al Sharpton and the Black Lives Matter movement ,  or the new bail law in New York or the criminal justice reform bill we're all supposed to like ,  stop  &  frisk actually saved lives ,  hundreds of lives . 
 And those lives are overwhelmingly young ,  black and Hispanic people . 
 In 1990 ,  New York City had more than 2 , 200 murders . 
 That's a lot . 
 The year Rudy Giuliani left office there were 649 murders . 
 Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg that number was cut in half  -  -  again . 
 It dropped to 322 murders . 
 A year . 
 In a city of eight million . 
 So New York wasn't just safer . 
 It was the single safest major city in America ,  maybe in the world outside of Tokyo . 
 And you know who agreed with that ?  Donald Trump . 
 Just four years ago in a debate with Hillary Clinton ,  then - candidate Trump said this :  In New York City ,  stop  &  frisk ,  we had 2 , 200 murders and stop  &  frisk brought it down to 500 murders . 
 Five hundred murders ,   [ is ]  a lot of murders . 
 Hard to believe . 
 Five hundred is supposed to be good ,  but we went from 2 ,  200 to five hundred and it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg . 
 And it was terminated by the current mayor . 
 But stop  &  frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City ,  tremendous beyond belief . 
 So when you say it has no impact ,  it really did . 
 It had a very ,  very big impact . 
 It's so funny because the essence of stop  &  frisk was taking illegal guns off the streets ,  something Democrats say they're for . 
 But no ,  they just want to take your guns out of your closet because you didn't vote for them . 
 In Trump's Republican convention speech later in 2016 ,  he laid out the consequences of rolling back effective criminal justice policies like stop  &  frisk :  Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration's rollback of criminal enforcement . 
  �  In this race for the White House ,  I am the law and order candidate . 
 Man was that true . 
 Nothing affects the lives of normal people ,  people without power more than high crime rates . 
 And if you haven't lived it . 
 Say a prayer that you never have to ,  because it's the worst thing you can imagine . 
 In 2016 Donald Trump understood that . 
 He didn't care about sneering elites in their gated communities ,  calling him racist . 
 He stood behind law and order policies that made life better for everyone . 
 Everyone of all backgrounds ,  ethnicities ,  colors ,  all Americans . 
 And it worked . 
 Trump did better than Mitt Romney did with black and Hispanic voters . 
 And that's part of the reason . 
  -  -  And that could happen again by the way . 
 Bloomberg is on his apology tour because apparently thinks he has to say it because he wants to win non - white voters ,  but apparently ,  he hasn't looked at the real numbers . 
 Data for Progress polled Democratic voters about their feelings on Mike Bloomberg . 
 When they brought up the question of stop  &  frisk the only group that didn't like it was white Democrats . 
 Black Democrats felt about the same way about Bloomberg after it was brought up . 
 Hispanic and Asian Democrats said they were more likely to vote for Mike Bloomberg after hearing about stop  &  frisk . 
 It's not really surprising . 
 Nobody in America of all races like crime ,  everyone wants the less of it . 
 The only people feel differently are white liberals . 
 So why are they bossing us around ?  We shouldn't let them . 
 But for some reason ,  the Republican Party is doing exactly that when they cede stop  &  frisk to the left . 
 Where is this going exactly ?  Four years from now will Republicans be denouncing bans on public urination as  " bigotry ?  "  Please . 
 All Americans deserve to live in a safe ,  clean ,  law - abiding ,  pleasant country . 
 If there's any reason to vote for Republicans ,  it's because they stand up for that . 
 And when they cease standing up for that ,  what's the point ?  Adapted from Tucker Carlson � s monologue on Friday ,  February 28 on  � Tucker Carlson Tonight . 
 �  Not so fast ,  Bernie !  Flavor Flav is calling out Sanders after the 2020 presidential hopeful falsely listed Flav's hip - hop group ,  Public Enemy ,  as the headliner for a campaign event Sunday . 
 A Nevada - based attorney for the rapper ,  whose real name is William Drayton Jr . 
 ,  fired off a cease - and - desist letter to Sanders' campaign ,  stressing that Flav and Public Enemy have not endorsed the Vermont senator . 
  " To be clear Flav and ,  by extension ,  the Hall of Fame hip hop act Public Enemy with which his likeness and name have become synonymous has not endorsed any political candidate in this election cycle and any suggestion to the contrary is plainly untrue ,  "  reads the letter from attorney Matthew H . 
 Friedman ,  obtained by Fox News . 
 The letter confirms that only one of the group's founders ,  Chuck D ,  is set to perform at Sanders' Los Angeles rally . 
 Still ,  Flav ripped the Democratic candidate for  " misleading "  supporters . 
  " The continued publicizing of this grossly misleading narrative is ,  at a minimum ,  careless and irresponsible if not intentionally misleading . 
 Flav is reaching out ,  not in the spirit of division ,  but for the sake of unity in the hope of preserving the integrity of the Public Enemy Movement and the faith and trust his millions of fans around the world have placed in him ,  "  the letter states . 
 The Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment . 
 Sanders' rally is being held at the Los Angeles Convention Center . 
 The 2020 hopeful's website lists an ad for the event ,  claiming that  " Public Enemy Radio "  is set to perform . 
  " Join Bernie Sanders ,  Sarah Silverman ,  and Dick Van Dyke ,  with a special performance by Public Enemy Radio . 
 Doors open at 3:00 pm . 
 and the event starts at 5:00 pm . 
 Capacity is limited and admission is granted on a first come ,  first served basis ,  "  the website states . 
 Sanders is known for his star - studded campaign events . 
 This past January ,  Sanders was reportedly joined by Vampire Weekend and Bon Iver in Iowa . 
 The Strokes also performed at a Sanders event held in New Hampshire ,  while Bela Fleck is set to play rallies in Massachusetts ,  The Hollywood Reporter said . 
 Flav further insists Sanders' campaign should change the misleading flyer to only include Chuck D's name . 
  " Sanders claims to represent everyman not the man yet his grossly irresponsible handling of Chuck's endorsement threatens to divide Public Enemy and ,  in so doing ,  forever silence one of our nation's loudest and most enduring voices for social change ,  "  the letter continues . 
 The reality television personality even included a personal note for Sanders in his own handwriting  " Hey Bernie ,  don't do this !  !  Flavor - Flav ,  "  the rapper signed the document along with a drawing of a clock as a nod to his signature clock necklace . 
 Sunday's event is just ahead of Super Tuesday . 
 In a recent Fox News poll ,  Sanders pushed Joe Biden out of the frontrunner spot for the Democratic nomination ,  capturing 31 percent support among primary voters . 
 Sanders has gained 8 percentage points since January ,  while Biden has dropped into second place with 18 percent ,  down 8 points . 
 The race looks almost the same+ when narrowed to Democratic primary voters in the 14 Super Tuesday states :  Sanders remains on top with 30 percent ,  followed by Bloomberg at 18 percent ,  Biden 17 percent ,  Warren 11 percent ,  and Buttigieg and Klobuchar 8 percent . 
 The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday suspended an order issued earlier in the day that blocked the Remain - in - Mexico policy  -  -  the cornerstone of the Trump administration's efforts in curbing the crisis at the southern border . 
 The panel in San Francisco had ruled in a 2 - 1 vote to put a hold on the policy  -  -  formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols  ( MPP )  . 
 But it later voted to suspend the order and told the government to file written arguments by the end of Monday and for the plaintiffs to respond by the end of Tuesday . 
  " This evening ,  with support of DOJ attorneys and CBP � s declaration ,  the 9th Circuit granted a stay of its earlier order enjoining MPP ,  "  Customs of Border Protection  ( CBP )  Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan tweeted . 
  "  @ CBP will immediately reinstate MPP !  "  The policy ,  which was established in January and expanded over the summer amid greater cooperation with Mexico ,  returns migrants seeking asylum to Mexico as they await their hearings ,  with courtrooms set up at key border points . 
 The policy was key in ending the process known as  � catch - and - release �  by which migrants were released into the interior ,  sometimes for years ,  until their cases were processed . 
 It was identified as a key  � pull factor �  in why migrants were flooding the border . 
 Officials said the process meant that cases could be heard in as little as 40 - 60 days ,  as opposed to the years it sometimes takes after family units are released into the US . 
 Those in favor of the program said that works better for the migrants ,  as it leaves them in limbo for less time ,  while also acting as a disincentive for Central American migrants who do not have legitimate asylum claims but might otherwise get into the US by claiming  � credible fear �  of returning home . 
 But the 9th Circuit accepted arguments that returning migrants to Mexico put them at risk of violence and kidnapping ,  saying not enough was done to protect them from harm . 
 Civil rights groups have called the policy  " secretive "  and part of an attack on legitimate asylum claims . 
 Multiple 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have promised to end the policy if elected to the White House . 
 Since MPP was expanded ,  there has been a dramatic drop in migrants coming to the border . 
 Officials have repeatedly said the policy ,  along with other international agreements with Central American countries ,  has been a significant factor in that reduction . 
 About 60 , 000 migrants had been returned to Mexico under the protocols . 
 The Justice Department had said Friday that at least 25 , 000 asylum seekers subject to the policy are currently waiting in Mexico and expressed  � massive and irreparable national - security of public - safety concerns "  if it was halted . 
 Attorneys said immigration lawyers had begun demanding that asylum seekers be allowed in the United States ,  with one insisting that 1 , 000 people be allowed to enter at one location . 
  � The Court � s reinstatement of the injunction causes the United States public and the government significant and irreparable harms  �  to border security ,  public safety ,  public health ,  and diplomatic relations ,  �  Justice Department attorneys wrote . 
 ACLU attorney Judy Rabinovitz called the suspension of Friday's order  " a temporary step . 
 "   � We will continue working to permanently end this unspeakably cruel policy ,  �  she said . 
 The government could appeal the case up to the Supreme Court where the government has been racking up wins on the subject of immigration . 
 Officials are in broad agreement on the importance of MPP if the crisis at the southern border is going to be prevented from flaring up once again as it did a year ago ,  when 144 , 000 migrants reached the border in April . 
  � The importance of MPP can � t be stated enough ,  it is what � s allowed us to take control of the crisis that we saw in April and May . 
 The idea is to make sure we process individuals in a timely manner but make sure they wait south of the border ,  �  Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told Fox News in November . 
 Wolf warned then that a ruling by the Ninth Circuit could have a dire effect on the US . 
 effort to regain control of its southern border . 
  � So you get an adverse ruling on MPP and it � s going to make the job of the men and women of Border Patrol as well as  [ Customs and Border Protection ]  and  [ Immigration and Customs Enforcement ]   . 
 very difficult for them ,  so it really can � t be overstated how much the program means to the department in controlling the crisis ,  �  he said . 
 The Associated Press reported that on Friday the liberal group Human Rights First hand - delivered a copy to CBP officers at a bridge connecting Laredo ,  Texas ,  and Nuevo Laredo ,  Mexico . 
 Lawyers were hoping to get their clients before US immigration court judges . 
 The Justice Department sharply criticized the ruling ,  saying it  � not only ignores the constitutional authority of Congress and the administration for a policy in effect for over a year ,  but also extends relief beyond the parties before the court . 
 �  Wolf called the decision  � grave and reckless . 
 �  After an airstrike ordered by the Syrian government killed at least 33 Turkish troops in Syria � s Idlib province Thursday ,  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is renewing calls for US and NATO military assistance . 
 The Trump administration should turn down the request . 
 Involving the United States in what is likely to be the final act of the Syrian civil war would be an enormous mistake . 
 The action the Trump administration should take ,  however ,  is to condemn Turkey � s recklessness and worsening of the humanitarian crisis in northwest Syria . 
 We should also withdraw the contingent of US troops still operating in Syria . 
 Neglecting these options risks getting the US more deeply entangled in a broader war . 
 On Feb 20 ,  as Turkish troops closed in on Syrian military locations in Idlib province ,  Erdogan made a direct request for US combat air patrols and for American anti - aircraft missile batteries to protect Turkish forces from Russian and Syrian aircraft over Idlib . 
 When the American support did not materialize ,  Erdogan pressed forward with military operations in Saraqeb ,  a small town along Syria � s critical M5 highway linking Damascus and Aleppo . 
 After a brutal clash ,  Turkey suffered heavy casualties in the nearby town of Balyun . 
 Following the military setback ,  Erdogan chaired an emergency national security council meeting in Istanbul ,  after which his official spokesman Fahrettin Altun ,  said :   � Our operations in the Syrian theater will continue until the blood - soaked hands taking aim at our flag are broken . 
 The decision to retaliate with far greater force against the illegitimate  [ Syrian ]  regime that pointed its guns at our soldiers has been made . 
 "  At the same time ,  Erdogan reached out to Moscow ,  asking for Russian President Vladimir Putin � s help . 
 Turkey then invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty in Belgium ,  summoning all 29 NATO ambassadors to a meeting . 
 Erdogan called on NATO to support him by setting up a no - fly zone over Idlib ,  where the airspace is under Russian control . 
 In the United States ,  Sen . 
 Lindsey Graham ,  R - SC . ,  wasted no time enthusiastically endorsing the idea . 
  " The world is sitting on its hands and watching the destruction of Idlib ,  "  Graham said in a statement . 
  " I am confident if the world ,  led by the United States ,  pushed back against Iran ,  Russia ,  and  [ Syrian President Bashar ]  Assad that they would stand down ,  paving the way for political negotiations to end this war in Syria . 
 "  Before President Trump ,  Congress ,  or any other Americans give any consideration to such a request ,  a brief refresher will prove useful to examine how we got to this point . 
 Syrian forces began their final assault to defeat regime enemies in the last major rebel holdout ,  Idlib ,  last spring ,  trapping more than 1 million innocent civilians between the two sides . 
 But in case that wasn � t enough ,  President Erdogan decided to complicate the picture further by unilaterally conquering and occupying a strip of Syrian territory  �  against US wishes  �  20 miles deep by 500 miles wide . 
 Moreover ,  Turkey has supported a group of rebels against the allied Syrian ,  Russian and Iranian forces in Idlib . 
 Against this backdrop of disastrous military operations ,  Erdogan has proven he will take whatever action he deems in Turkey � s interests ,  wholly independent of what is good for the US or NATO . 
 Erdogan ignored Washington � s plea that he not move his troops into Syrian territory . 
 He ignored NATO � s protests and made a deal with Russia to get advanced S - 400 anti - aircraft defense systems . 
 And he detained a US citizen to pressure Washington . 
 Now ,  after ignoring American ,  NATO and Russian pleas to refrain from a military incursion into Syria ,  Erdogan demands Western help . 
 None should be provided . 
 Here is the critical point to understand :  there are no  � good �  and  � bad �  guys in this situation ;  only multiple actors with conflicting self - interests ,  none of which benefit us . 
 Opposite the Syrian regime forces in Idlib are thousands of militant Islamic fighters ,  many of whom are allied with Al Qaeda . 
 Turkey is fighting against elements of both sides . 
 The last thing Washington should do is provide cover for Turkey ,  underwriting Ankara � s regional ambitions that are worsening a humanitarian crisis and deepening a chaotic war . 
 While there is nothing to gain for American intervention in Syria ,  there is a great deal to lose . 
 Russia already commands the airspace over Idlib ,  so trying to set up a NATO no - fly zone in the same area could potentially spark a war with a nuclear superpower . 
 Already ,  our tiny contingent of troops in Syria  �  serving as targets  �  have had several near - clashes with Russian troops . 
 It would be beyond foolish to insert ourselves into a late - stage civil war disconnected from US security . 
 Washington should immediately withdraw all US troops from Syria before any mishaps occur or any Americans are killed . 
 Turkey was warned repeatedly in the months before its ill - considered invasion of Syria . 
 We should not risk getting sucked into yet another Middle Eastern war by bailing Turkey out now . 
 The United States signed a historic peace treaty with Taliban militants on Saturday ,  aimed at ending the 18 - year war in Afghanistan that began after the Sept . 
 11 ,  2001 terrorist attacks . 
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke cautiously in front of Taliban leaders in Doha ,  Qatar ,  calling the agreement a  � true test �  of their commitment to peace . 
  � We will closely watch the Taliban � s compliance with their commitments and calibrate the pace of our withdrawal to their actions . 
 This is how we will ensure that Afghanistan never again serves as a base for international terrorists ,  �  he said . 
 Pompeo � s arrival in Doha ,  Qatar on Saturday followed reports that ,  just days earlier ,  he had informed a conference of US ambassadors at the State Department that he was only attending the signing because President Trump has insisted on his participation ,  two people present told The Associated Press . 
  � This agreement will mean nothing and today � s good feelings will not last if we don � t take concrete actions on commitments and promises that have been made ,  �  Pompeo said ,  seemingly directed at his counterparts . 
 Among those in attendance were leaders of the Taliban ,  who harbored Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network as they plotted ,  and then celebrated ,  the hijackings of four airliners that were crashed into lower Manhattan ,  the Pentagon and a field in western Pennsylvania ,  killing almost 3 , 000 people . 
 As part of the agreement ,  the US is drawing back a number of the approximately 13 , 000 troops stationed there ,  although more than 8 , 000 will remain to ensure certain counter - terrorism conditions are met by the Taliban . 
 Another condition of the agreement calls for the release of 5 , 000 Taliban members from Afghan - run jails ,  although it was not clear if the Afghan government will comply with that . 
 A senior administration official told reporters earlier this week that the deal  " explicitly mentions al Qaeda "  and calls for the Taliban to cut all ties . 
 The US is also working for a  " complete ceasefire "  which will be discussed in Oslo on March 10 . 
  � I know there will be a temptation to declare victory but victory ,  victory for Afghans ,  will only be achieved when they can live in peace and prosper ,  �  Pompeo warned . 
  � Victory for the United States will only be achieved when Americans and our allies no longer have to fear a terrorist threat from Afghanistan and we will do whatever it takes to protect our people . 
 �  Sen . 
 Bernie Sanders ,  the improbable current front - runner for the Democratic presidential nomination ,  is lying to the American people when he tell us that  � democratic socialism �  simply means he wants to give the vast majority of Americans new opportunities to succeed and wants millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes . 
 In fact ,  my extensive research on comments Sanders has made going back decades shows he has warmly embraced not just socialism but communism ,  and praised tyrannical dictatorships that have trashed the freedoms Americans enjoy under the Bill of Rights that are part of our Constitution . 
 Sanders is not just another liberal Democrat who wants to expand social programs ,  in the tradition of Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson . 
 He is the most radical candidate in American history with a real shot at winning the presidential nomination of one of our two major political parties . 
 While candidates have run for president in the past on radical platforms under the banners of socialist ,  communist and other fringe political parties ,  they have drawn only tiny percentages of the vote . 
 Sanders ,  elected in Vermont as an independent and not as a Democrat ,  is trying to convince the American people that policies implemented around the world by socialist and communist regimes that have resulted in death ,  destruction and economic mayhem are in our best interest . 
 But like the wolf in the children � s tale of Little Red Riding Hood who donned a nightgown and covered his face to pose as the young girl � s grandmother ,  Sanders tries to disguise socialism . 
 The socialist senator wants us to believe socialism is a kind and caring philosophy that is the embodiment of justice and equality for all . 
 Sanders thinks that by sticking the word  � democratic �  in front of the word  � socialism �  he can trick millions of Americans into supporting the horrific philosophy he espouses . 
 As the old saying goes ,   � power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely . 
 �  Communism and socialism give government far more power than our capitalist system does ,  enabling leaders to become tyrants . 
 This has been proven the case again and again in dozens of nations that have abandoned capitalism for communism and socialism . 
 The truth is that more than 167 million people were exiled ,  imprisoned ,  or killed by socialist and communist parties in the 20th century . 
 And ,  contrary to claims made by Sanders ,  his talking points about socialism � s successes in countries such as Sweden ,  Norway and Denmark are completely false . 
 Those countries are not socialist nations and their citizens are ,  in many ways ,  not better off than most Americans . 
 Yet despite these well - documented facts ,  Sanders has managed to sell his socialist snake oil to many well - meaning ,  kind - hearted Americans who think that the only way to solve the world � s problems is to give government far more power over their lives . 
 The following quotes from Sanders illustrate just how truly radical and disturbing his ideology is . 
 Police departments are controlled by  � fascists and Nazis �  In a  � special interview �  in 1981 with a communist newspaper called The Militant ,  Sanders ,  who had just become mayor of Burlington ,  Vt . 
 ,  claimed there are American police departments  � dominated by fascists and Nazis . 
 �   � We � ve got cops here who are good trade unionists on all the regular trade union issues ,  and who also have a concern for young people ,  �  Sanders told The Militant ,  in reaction to some concerns voiced by socialists who were worried that he received too much support from local police during his 1980 mayoral campaign . 
 In other words ,  Burlington had good cops  �  but bad cops dominated many other police departments . 
 The attack Sanders made on police is not only outrageous ,  it � s also incredibly ironic . 
 The Nazis were ,  in fact ,  socialists who believed in collectively managing property and most of the German economy . 
 Further ,  some of the most ruthless ,  murderous regimes to exist during the past 100 years were led by committed Marxists  �  not free - market capitalists devoted to defending individual rights . 
 Support of communist organizations and Cuba Sanders has a long track record of supporting communist and socialist organizations . 
 For example ,  in 1980 and 1984 ,  he endorsed Socialist Workers Party presidential candidates ,  and he even agreed to be an elector for the party . 
 This shows clearly that Sanders is no Democrat . 
 He � s an opportunistic radical trying to hijack the Democratic Party and turn it into a socialist party . 
 In the 1980s ,  the Socialist Workers Party was mostly devoted to espousing radical Marxist and communist ideas ,  and it was widely known as being largely Trotskyite  �  an ideology made famous by Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky ,  who promoted the necessity of global communism . 
 According to an article in The Militant ,  Sanders issued a press release in 1980 in which he said he supported the Socialist Workers Party in part because of its  � continued defense of the Cuban revolution . 
 �  At the time Sanders lauded the  � Cuban revolution ,  �  the ruthless dictator Fidel Castro had been in power for two decades . 
 During that period Castro stripped Cubans of their basic political and individual rights ,  murdered and imprisoned dissenters and welcomed Soviet missiles to his island nation . 
 That action led to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 ,  which brought the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war . 
 A crusade against capitalism Sanders has a long track record of framing his ideology as one that is completely contrary to capitalism . 
 This precludes any possibility that he wants to merely reform America � s current market - based system . 
 For example ,  in a speech Sanders delivered in May 1981 while introducing the head of the Socialist Workers Party ,  he explained that the  � real debate of our time �  and the  � debate of our century �  is  � socialism versus capitalism . 
 �  Further ,  throughout the 1980s Sanders said the Democratic Party was not radical enough to accomplish his goal to usher in his Marxist utopia and win the  � socialism versus capitalism �  debate . 
 For instance ,  according to reports by the Burlington Free Press ,  in a speech Sanders delivered in the early 1980s before students at the Vermont Law School he said Vermont needed a new and radical party that  � must develop a membership base of workers and farmers �  and called for  � the rejection of the Democratic and Republican parties . 
 �  Based on his own words ,  it is clear that the  � revolution �  Sanders is always talking about staging would spell the end of capitalism and economic freedom in the United States that made us the richest ,  most prosperous and most powerful nation on Earth . 
 And once economic freedom goes ,  history has shown that political freedom and many of our human rights go as well . 
 My question to each of you reading these words is simple :  Do you really want to see America turned into a  � workers �  paradise �  like China ,  Russia ,  North Korea ,  Cuba ,  Venezuela and so many other failed communist and socialist nations ?  Sanders doesn � t frame his campaign that way ,  of course . 
 But that is the choice facing voters . 
 COLUMBIA ,  SC . 
  �  A confident Joe Biden says he's  " very optimistic "  about his chances to win the Democratic nomination . 
 The former vice president told reporters on Saturday morning that he's  " optimistic not just about today "  but about  " the whole process from here on out . 
 "  Biden spoke to reporters soon after voting got underway in South Carolina ,  the first Southern state to weigh in on the race for the Democratic presidential nomination . 
 For the one - time unrivaled front - runner in the Democratic nomination race ,  a victory is essential as the future of his White House bid is on the line . 
 And Biden predicted that  " the bigger the win "  in South Carolina ,   " the bigger the bump "  he'll get going into the 14 Super Tuesday states that hold contests in three days . 
 Biden predicted that a strong win in South Carolina will  " put me in a position to do well in North Carolina and Alabama and other states that I think in the Democratic primary I can do very well . 
 "   " I don't think it'll even be over after Super Tuesday . 
 I thnk it's so it can go on to states that are ones I feel very good about ,  "  he emphasized . 
 While Sen . Bernie Sanders of Vermont doesn � t have to win in South Carolina ,  he � d like to make it three wins in a row  �  after narrowly winning in New Hampshire and routing his rivals in last weekend � s Nevada caucuses . 
 And a strong performance among black voters on Saturday could further cement his status as the undisputed front - runner for the party's nomination  -  -  and the right to face President Trump in November . 
 On the eve of the primary ,  Biden spoke to supporters at a rally in Spartanburg . 
  � This state lifted Barack Obama to the presidency ,  "  Biden said . 
  " And now once again this state holds in its hands ,  literally ,  especially the state � s African American community ,  the power to determine �  who the next nominee of the Democratic Party � s going to be �   " You hold in your hand the future of the Democratic Party . 
 "  For a second straight night Biden drew a crowd of roughly 750 people  �  large by Biden standards . 
 Biden is banking on a win in South Carolina to re - energize his flagging campaign . 
 But a loss would likely bring an end to his third bid for the White House . 
 Biden's long looked to the Palmetto State  �  where black voters make up roughly 60 percent of the Democratic presidential primary electorate  �  as his firewall . 
 Thanks to his eight years as vice president under President Barack Obama ,  Biden remains very popular with African - American voters . 
 And after disappointing fourth -  and fifth - place finishes in the predominantly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire ,  as well as a distant second place finish to Sanders in Nevada  �  South Carolina is even more vital to Biden . 
 A Real Clear Politics average of the seven polls conducted this week shows Biden with a small double - digit lead over Sanders among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in South Carolina . 
 Biden has enjoyed a very good week . 
 Thanks to a muscular performance in Tuesday � s prime time Democratic nomination debate in Charleston ,  the campaign touted that it hauled in  $ 1 . 
2 million from nearly 30 , 000 donors on Wednesday  �  an impressive figure for a candidate who has struggled all cycle with fundraising . 
 On Saturday ,  Biden told reporters  " we've been raising about a million dollars a day for the last week or so .  
I think what what will happen in we win solidly here ?  I think it's going to raise us a lot of money . 
 A lot of enthusiasm . 
 "  Biden this week also landed the endorsement from longtime Rep . 
 James Clyburn  �  the dean of Palmetto State Democrats . 
 The backing by Clyburn ,  the most senior black politician in the state ,  was seen as a boost for Biden . 
 Biden � s team is hoping a convincing victory in South Carolina will generate plenty of national media attention  �  to propel him into next week's Super Tuesday primaries  �  where some giant states like California and Texas hold contests and a third of all Democratic presidential nomination delegates are up for grabs . 
 He � ll need it  �  because as he � s concentrated all his energy on South Carolina the past week  �  Biden has badly trailed nearly all his rivals when it comes to investing time and money on the Super Tuesday states . 
 But even before the results come in ,  Biden believes he � s already a winner in the Palmetto State . 
 He told reporters Friday that he � s already gotten enough of boost from his time there that will carry over into Tuesday � s coast - to - coast contests . 
 Sanders resonates A lot less is on the line for Sanders ,  who claimed a raw vote win in Iowa � s caucuses ,  won an outright in New Hampshire � s primary ,  and pummeled his rivals in Nevada . 
 But after performing extremely well with Spanish - speaking and black voters last weekend in Nevada ,  a solid showing with African - Americans in South Carolina will further boost Sanders heading into Super Tuesday ,  where there � s a large non - white Democratic presidential primary electorate in the four largest states to hold contests  �  California ,  Texas ,  North Carolina and Virginia . 
 Sanders ,  who � s making his second straight White House run  �  got his clock cleaned by eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 South Carolina primary . 
 Thanks to her dominance with black voters ,  Clinton topped Sanders by a nearly 3 - to - 1 margin . 
 But fast forward four years and Sanders is resonating with African - Americans . 
 South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Trav Robertson gives Sanders credit for turning things around . 
  � I think one of the most fascinating things is that Bernie Sanders appears to have learned from his loss from 2016 in South Carolina ,  �  Robertson told reporters Thursday . 
 Robertson spotlighted that top Sanders surrogates in South Carolina  � have done a very good job of trying to make sure that Senator Sanders did not forsake smaller venues with small numbers of people of color for ,  let � s say ,  three or four thousand people . 
 �  Sanders touted his electability in his last rally in South Carolina ahead of Saturday � s primary ,  at a park in downtown Columbia on Friday afternoon . 
  " Take a look at the last 60 national polls that have been done ,  "  Sanders told the crowd . 
  " Bernie beats Trump 56 out of the 60 times . 
 Take a look at some of the polls in the battleground states like Pennsylvania ,  Wisconsin ,  Michigan  -  -  Bernie beats Trump . 
 �  Electability had long been one of Biden � s major selling points  �  that he was the strongest Democratic candidate capable of taking on Trump in November . 
 But thanks to his primary calendar winning streak ,  Sanders has seen his national poll numbers soar in recent weeks . 
 Now more Democrats are starting to see the independent senator as the strongest contender to defeat Trump . 
 Steyer optimistic After poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire ,  Tom Steyer was hoping for a strong finish in Nevada . 
 The billionaire hedge fund manager - turned - environmental and progressive advocate spent a lot of money and time in the Silver State ,  but didn � t get his bang for his buck as he finished in the low single digits in last weekend � s caucuses . 
 But Steyer  �  who has been heavily courting black voters  �  is optimistic things will be different in South Carolina . 
 The latest polls place him in third place  �  behind Biden and Sanders . 
 Steyer told Fox News on Friday how he viewed his chances . 
  " We have a very good team here . 
 I � ve spent a lot of time on the ground and I � m talking straightforwardly about issues ,  "  he said . 
  " This is a heavily African - American state . 
 I talk very straightforwardly about race . 
 I � m the only person talking about reparations for slavery . 
 I think I � ve been here the most and looked most people in the eye and talked most straightforwardly and I think that � s why . 
 �  Asked how a solid finish in South Carolina would help him in the Super Tuesday states ,  Steyer said ,   � I think that � s a springboard for people to think that I can pull this party together ,  which is what I want . 
 �  Robertson ,  the state party leader ,  gave Steyer credit . 
  " It appears he resonates very well . 
 He � s very personable ,  "  Robertson said . 
  " I � m not going to be surprised if Steyer wins a delegate or two . 
 �  And he predicted that if Steyer does well ,  it would take a bite out of Biden � s support among older black voters . 
 Steyer showed off his moves Friday night  -  -  dancing onstage to a live performance of  " Back That Azz Up "  by rapper Juvenile at his primary - eve rally . 
 The event was held at Columbia's Allen University ,  a historially black college . 
 Steyer and Biden are the only two Democratic candidates who will be in South Carolina when the polls close Saturday night . 
 Challenge for Buttigieg Former South Bend ,  Ind . 
 ,  Mayor Pete Buttigieg � s struggles to resonate with black voters have been well - documented by political reporters . 
 While his campaign is keeping expectations low in South Carolina  �  a senior campaign aide who asked to remain anonymous ,  to speak more freely ,  told Fox News they � re looking for a fourth -  or fifth - place finish  �  it also hopes to demonstrate that Buttigieg can court black voters . 
 Buttigieg was introduced at a primary - eve town hall in Columbia by Miss Black America Ryann Richardson ,  who has endorsed the 38 - year - old Afghanistan War veteran . 
 Buttigieg told the predominantly white crowd of more than 1 , 000 people that South Carolinians were  � in the heart of the most important thing happening in democracy right now �  and he asked for their support to make history and change the course of the country . 
  " Before it is too late ,  �  he added . 
 An energetic Elizabeth Warren introduced herself to the crowd at a canvass kickoff in Greenville on Friday as  � the woman who � s going to beat Donald Trump . 
 �  But the best finish the senator from Massachusetts has seen so far on the primary calendar was a bronze medal in Iowa  �  and it doesn � t appear that she � ll match that in South Carolina . 
 But Warren gets some credit for returning to the Palmetto State on Friday to campaign after spending Thursday in Texas ,  the second - largest of the Super Tuesday states . 
 On Saturday morning ,  after holding her last campaign event in the Palmetto State ,  Warren brushed off questions from reporters on the need for a primary victory ,  saying  " I don't do polls and I don't do predictions . 
 And she evaded a question from Fox News on whehter she has any thoughts going forward of an alliance with Sanders . 
 Warren instead spotlighted her longtime friendship with her fellow progressive champion in the Senate . 
 Sen . 
 Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  �  whose South Carolina expectations are minimal  �  moved on to stump in Super Tuesday states following Tuesday night � s debate . 
 Mike Bloomberg also departed South Carolina after this week � s debate  �  but Bloomberg is not on the ballot in the Palmetto State  �  as he skipped all four early - voting states to concentrate his time ,  energy and vast resources on the delegate - rich Super Tuesday states . 
 With coast - to - coast voting in those 14 states coming just three days after the first - in - the - South primary ,  South Carolina � s results could have an immediate impact on Democratic race . 
 The Trump administration is considering using special executive powers to ramp up US production of protective face masks and clothing to combat the domestic spread of coronavirus . 
 Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Friday that the administration may invoke the 1950 Defense Production Act ,  which was passed by Congress before the Korean War and gives the president the power to increase the production of materials for national security purposes ,  Reuters reported . 
  � We will use the Defense Production Act as necessary ,  �  Azar said . 
  � So that is the authority that we have and we intend to use to acquire anything we need to acquire . 
 �  There were more than 60 cases of the virus in the US as of Friday night ,  including three patients who likely didn � t contract it abroad . 
  " We haven't lost anybody yet and hopefully we can keep that intact ,  �  President Trump said Friday . 
 This week ,  he tapped Vice President Mike Pence to lead the administration � s coronavirus task force . 
 Azar said the US needs approximately 300 million N95 respirator masks for medical personnel working with the virus but he admitted the country only has a fraction of that number ,  Reuters reported . 
  � Very little of this stuff is apparently made in the States ,  �  the Department of Homeland Security told Reuters . 
  � So if we � re down to domestic capability to produce ,  it could get tough . 
 �  China controls  � a lot of the raw materials as well as the manufacturing capacity ,  �  Azar said ,  according to Reuters . 
 Not a single member of Congress should reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act program that's coming up for a vote mid - March unless significant reforms are made that protect Americans' civil liberties and privacy . 
 This includes protections for the current president of the United States  -  -  and future administrations and their associates  -  -  who should never be spied on for illegitimate and political purposes like we saw during the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane operation against Donald Trump and his campaign in the lead - up to the 2016 election . 
  " They spied on the Trump campaign in 2016 ,  "  Rep . 
 Jim Jordan ,  R - Ohio ,  tweeted . 
  " We need to reform FISA so that they can't do it again in 2020 . 
 "  The ranking member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee is correct . 
 There was an attempted coup by former FBI Director James Comey ,  disgraced former FBI agent Peter Strzok and other nefarious actors at the highest echelons of the Department of Justice who colluded to stop Donald Trump from getting elected . 
 When that election meddling failed ,  conspirators implemented the infamous  " insurance policy "  to ultimately impeach and remove a duly elected president . 
 An outrage that should never happen in America a country founded on free elections . 
 Some of the deceptive tools that were used to fuel the manufactured Russian collusion hoax and trigger a special counsel investigation and other criminal probes to smear and derail Trump and his associates were fraudulent FISA applications obtained by FBI and DOJ officials . 
 This scandal is far bigger than Watergate ,  and arguably more damaging to our country ,  but doesn't get the media attention it deserves because the partisan  # FakeNews media was in on the hoax from the start  -  -  to tip the 2016 presidential election to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party . 
 And the intelligence community inspector general's report released last year was damning . 
 Its investigation revealed that powerful officials at the FBI and DOJ misled the FISA court in obtaining the surveillance warrants  -  -  a whopping 17 times . 
 This includes material omissions and the withholding of exculpatory evidence . 
 The IG report also revealed an anti - Trump FBI lawyer doctored evidence to get the warrants to spy on Carter Page ,  a former foreign policy adviser with the 2016 Trump campaign . 
 This cannot stand . 
 There must be significant reforms put in place to make sure this type of unchecked corruption never happens again to any American . 
 Yet ,  high - ranking congressional Democrats including House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff ,  D - Calif . 
 ,  and others in the DC . 
 swamp aren't interested in cleaning up the corruption . 
 Nor are they interested in holding bad actors accountable . 
  " Only in Washington ,  DC . 
 could we get an IG report detailing the kind of appalling FISA abuse we saw at the FBI and then consider cleanly reauthorizing the program ,  without first changing it ,  "  Rep . 
 Mark Meadows ,  R - NC . ,  tweeted . 
  " Just nuts . 
 It is unacceptable . 
 And Americans of BOTH parties should demand better . 
 "  Amen . 
 A failure to do so will incentivize nefarious actors in the government and US intelligence agencies to repeat history . 
 And make no mistake  -  -  no one is safe . 
 Just remember ,  if the FBI and DOJ can spy on the president of the United States and his campaign associates using a false pretext and fake  " dossier "  manufactured by his political opponents ,  then they can do the same to any American . 
 If that doesn't send a chill up your spine ,  what will ?  After listening to the Democrats attack President Trump and smear Vice President Mike Pence over the coronavirus ,  it hit me that it is vital for Republicans to focus on the virus  �  specifically its challenges to human health ,  jobs ,  and the economy . 
 There is a real temptation to descend to the level of the left � s dishonest ,  false ,  and often vicious attacks about the Trump administration � s response to the potential pandemic . 
 However ,  that would be exactly the wrong reaction . 
 Just as the contrast between Trump in India and the pathetic South Carolina debate emphasized the stature difference between the president as a world leader and a group of noisy ,  desperate politicians ,  there is an opportunity for the Trump administration and congressional Republicans to demonstrate patriotism ,  seriousness and focusing on solving real problems for real people . 
 The contrast between bitterly partisan ,  negative ,  and divisive Democrats such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ,  D - Calif . 
 ,  and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ,  D - NY . ,  and the serious ,  focused effort of Trump and Pence is important . 
 It can go a long way toward convincing the country that there is a serious ,  problem - solving Republican Party and a petty ,  divisive Democratic Party . 
 There are serious questions that need answering . 
 We need certainty about the health aspects of the coronavirus . 
 We also need to understand the implications of the collapse of the Chinese economy and its ability to undermine the world logistics system and damage other economies ,  including our own . 
 First ,  let � s look at the health aspects of coronavirus . 
 I was fortunate to do a  " Newt's World "  episode on Feb . 
 9 with one of the great experts on viruses ,  Dr . 
 Tony Fauci . 
 He is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
 During our discussion ,  Fauci ,  who was one of the heroic figures in developments on HIV / AIDS in the 1980s ,  outlined the sound scientific approach to thinking through a potential viral epidemic or pandemic . 
 I recommend it as excellent background material . 
 We must continue to monitor people who come to the United States . 
 It is clear that Trump � s decision to implement travel restrictions has reduced the threat of importing coronavirus and kept the United States safer . 
 One key concern is to develop new capabilities for early detection of the virus ,  so people can easily distinguish the common cold ,  the ordinary flu ,  and coronavirus . 
 Another key concern is to increase the number of medicines which can be used to heal a person if they do become infected . 
 Timely health care intervention seems to have a dramatic impact on survival rates . 
 Some of the Chinese death rates may have been a function of inadequate treatments  �  especially for the elderly . 
  ( There are reports of substantial fatality rates among some nursing homes in Wuhan for example . 
 )  Also ,  we need to figure out why some people who appear to be recovering from the virus begin to relapse . 
 There is a substantial effort underway to develop a vaccine . 
 This is important because we must consider the real possibility that coronavirus will behave like the regular flu and disappear in warm weather and reappear in the fall . 
 There is a real possibility that sometime next year we will have a vaccine just as we vaccinate against the common flu . 
 Ironically ,  it is the expertise of the pharmaceutical industry which is being brought to bear to potentially save millions  �  and even tens of millions of lives . 
 The next time you hear the American pharmaceutical industry attacked ,  you might remember how vital it is when we need it . 
 Proposals that would undermine and even destroy our research capabilities are proposals that will cost millions of lives in the future . 
 America has the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ,  the finest epidemiological center in the world . 
 We have in the National Institutes of Health ,  the largest and most capable biological research system in the world . 
 It is at times like this that our investment in these capabilities is seen as truly vital and wise . 
 A key question is how much we will need to spend to accelerate research and moving treatments from the laboratory to your medicine cabinet . 
 Some Food and Drug Administration protocols and regulations may need to be revised to maximize the rate of getting the new drugs to the patients who will need them . 
 Finally ,  we have to examine thoroughly local public health plans . 
 When San Francisco announces a public health emergency before a single case has been reported in the city ,  some tough questions need to be asked . 
 In a city which has thousands of homeless people living on the street  �  and in which the district attorney has announced he will not prosecute public defecation and urination  �  how would you quarantine homeless people if they became infected . 
 San Francisco is faced with an impossible dilemma :  Take the virus seriously and change the pattern of disease - breeding lack of law ,  or accept that there is a large vulnerable population on the streets who would be very susceptible to an epidemic . 
 Beyond health issues we also must confront the danger to our economy the Chinese meltdown is posing . 
 There are a surprising number of medicines ,  face masks ,  syringes ,  and other medical supplies which come from China . 
 There are a significant number of American companies that will have their production disrupted because they rely on Chinese parts in the logistics chain . 
 One step toward recognizing how unhealthy our reliance on Chinese production is would be to create a one - time tax credit for insourcing production which has been outsourced to China . 
 We might well convince a substantial number of companies to bring their production home to the United States now that the precariousness of the Chinese system is so obvious . 
 If we approach the challenge of the coronavirus as serious adults ,  there is no reason to believe we can � t solve both the health and the economic problems . 
 After Richard Nixon's landslide 1972 victory over Democratic opponent George McGovern ,  New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael gave a speech in which she said :   " I live in a rather special world . 
 I only know one person who voted for Nixon . 
 Where they are I don't know . 
 They're outside my ken . 
 But sometimes when I'm in a theater I can feel them . 
 "  2020 Democrats ,  at least the sensible ones ,  find themselves in a full - blown panic over the prospect of a nominee who is outside their ken . 
 How scared are they ?  About the prospect of Sen . 
 Bernie Sanders ,  I - Vt . 
 ,  leading the Democratic ticket ,  top Democratic strategist James Carville said :   " I'm 75 years old . 
 Why am I here doing this ?  Because I am scared to death ,  that's why . 
 Let's get relevant here  . 
 All the Sanders people are taking pictures wishing  ( British Labour Party leader )  Jeremy Corbyn the best . 
 I don't want to go down that path !  "  He added :   " We've got to decide what we want to be . 
 Do we want to be an ideological cult ?  Or do we want to have a majoritarian instinct to be a majority party ?  What we need is power ,  you understand ?  That's what this is about . 
 Without power ,  you have nothing . 
 You just have talking points . 
 "  Rational Democratic strategists like Carville find themselves in a full - blown panic over polls showing that a growing number of Democrats prefer Sanders to lead the 2020 Democratic ticket . 
 Even worse for Democrats ,  Sanders' supporters are either passionate true believers or do not believe that Sanders faces electoral disaster  -  -  or do not care as long as his policies are promoted . 
 Trump enjoys a 94 percent approval rating among Republicans ,  but Democrats split their support between the Sanders / Warren hard - left wing of the party and the so - called moderates . 
 The percentage of the Iowa vote captured by Sanders and Sen . 
 Elizabeth Warren ,  D - Mass . 
 ,  came to 44 percent . 
 But the percentage of the votes received by former South Bend ,  Ind . 
 Mayor Pete Buttigieg ,  Sen . 
 Amy Klobuchar ,  D - Minn . 
 ,  and former Vice President Joe Biden comes to 54 percent . 
 Similarly ,  New Hampshire saw Buttigieg / Klobuchar / Biden getting 53 percent ,  with the Sanders / Warren vote fetching 35 percent . 
 In the Nevada caucus ,  Sanders did even better ,  capturing almost 47 percent of the vote ,  but the combined percentage of the Biden / Buttigieg / Klobuchar vote came to just under 39 percent . 
 Good luck converting those voters to Sanders voters after Biden / Buttigieg / Klobuchar characterized Sanders as a wacky socialist who does not know or does not care about the price tag for his many programs . 
 Still worse for Democrats is that Trump is enjoying the highest approval ratings of his presidency . 
 Gallup recently said :   " President Donald Trump's job approval rating has risen to 49 percent ,  his highest in Gallup polling since he took office in 2017 . 
 Trump's approval rating has risen because of higher ratings among both Republicans and independents . 
 His 94 percent approval rating among Republicans is up six percentage points from early January and is three points higher than his previous best among his fellow partisans . 
 The 42 percent approval rating among independents is up five points ,  and ties three other polls as his best among that group . 
 Democratic approval is 7 percent ,  down slightly from 10 percent . 
 "  Former frontrunner Biden is betting his flailing candidacy on doing well in the upcoming South Carolina primary . 
 But Biden ,  whose front - runner status has been built on black support ,  is watching a severe erosion among those voters . 
 FiveThirtyEight wrote :   " In an average of national polls ,  Biden's support among black voters has dropped about 12 percentage points from before the Iowa caucuses to the post - New Hampshire period . 
 Conversely ,  during the same period ,  Bloomberg and Sanders  . 
 each gained 10 points among black voters . 
 And recent polls show Biden dropping fast among all voters while Sanders and Bloomberg are gaining ground . 
 "  So ,  Biden is a dead man walking . 
 He looks confused and disoriented . 
 At a recent South Carolina breakfast speech ,  Biden said :   " My name's Joe Biden . 
 I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate . 
 Look me over . 
 If you like what you see ,  help out . 
 If not ,  vote for the other Biden . 
 Give me a look ,  though ,  OK ?  "  Senate ?  The other Biden ?  And The Washington Post awarded him four Pinocchios ,  as bad a rating as it gives ,  for Biden's recent claim that ,  when in the Senate ,  he got arrested for attempting to visit an imprisoned Nelson Mandela in South Africa . 
 Biden also said that ,  when freed ,  Mandela thanked Biden for the attempted visit . 
 There is not evidence for either claim . 
 His argument has always been  " electability ,  "  yet he cannot win a caucus or primary in his own party . 
 A third of Americans disapprove of gay marriage ,  making the prospects of a Buttigieg nomination unlikely ,  quite apart from his thin resume as a mayor of a small town . 
 Mike Bloomberg cannot win the nomination of a party where so many despise billionaires and would not ,  under any circumstances ,  vote for a multibillionaire late entrant who  " bought his way in . 
 "  This leaves Klobuchar as last Democratic moderate standing . 
 But the passion is with the surging Sanders . 
 All signs ,  at this juncture ,  suggest that Republicans in November will party like it's 1972 . 
 Rep . Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez warned that electing Mike Bloomberg in November would pave the way for another candidate who could be  � even worse �  than President Trump . 
 The freshman lawmaker said she thinks it � s  � not a good idea �  to put the former three - term New York mayor in the White House even if he is the candidate who could beat Trump . 
  � We obviously have to beat Trump ,  �  she told  � The Breakfast Club �  show on Power 105 . 
1 AM on Tuesday . 
  � But if we beat Trump and go back to the same policies that we had before ,  a worse Trump is going to come . 
 A Trump that � s more sophisticated ,  whose fascism is less obvious ,  is going to come and things could get even worse . 
 �  Ocasio - Cortez ,  who has spoken at Sen . 
 Bernie Sanders �  campaign rallies ,  noted how Bloomberg � s controversial policies like stop - and - frisk and his comments about how ending the discriminatory practice of redlining contributed to the 2008 financial meltdown are coming attractions of a Bloomberg presidency . 
  � A lot of people don � t know Bloomberg . 
 We � re here in New York City . 
 We lived under his tenure as mayor ,  �  she said . 
  � We know exactly what he did . 
 This is part of what he � s doing when he comes in ,  swoops in super late in the game with billions of dollars at his disposal and is able to kind of shower the airwaves with his cash . 
 �  Bloomberg ,  whose worth is estimated at  $ 65 billion ,  has spent more than  $ 400 million on a nationwide campaign ad blitz since entering the race in November . 
 AOC said despite his apologies for using the practice of stop - and - frisk ,  Bloomberg has not done enough in the eyes of minority voters to become a presidential candidate . 
  � I think that redemption in politics is an acceptable thing ,  but you have to earn it ,  �  Ocasio - Cortez said . 
  � It needs to be proven through years of work and evolution for the right thing . 
 �   � This is what happened with Bloomberg . 
 He was down with stop - and - frisk . 
 He fought for it in the courts ,  the courts overturned it as unconstitutional . 
 He still fought it ,  defended it after him being mayor and then  �  five minutes before he runs for president ,  he says ,   � Okay ,  maybe this wasn � t the right policy . 
' �  President Trump accused his Democratic critics of  " politicizing "  the coronavirus virus as he rallied supporters in North Charleston a day before the Democratic primary in South Carolina . 
 Speaking at the North Charleston Coliseum for more than an hour ,  Trump dismissed the complaints from Democrats about his handling of the virus as  � their new hoax �  and insisted  � we are totally prepared . 
 �  He also mocked the party for its chaotic efforts to count the votes earlier this month in Iowa's caucuses . 
  � Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus ,  �  Trump said ,  adding :   � They can � t even count their votes . 
 �  Speaking at length about the virus ,  Trump said it  � starts in China ,  bleeds its way into various countries around the world ,  doesn � t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions �  of his administration . 
 But still ,  Trump argued ,  the Democrats are claiming that  � it � s Donald Trump � s fault . 
 �  Turning to the 2020 race ,  Trump took an informal poll of the crowd over who they would prefer he run against in November . 
 The president argued that despite the many candidates still in the race ,  the fight for the Democratic nomination is really down to former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen . 
 Bernie Sanders . 
  " Who the hell is easier to beat ?  �  Trump asked the crowd ,  going on to use nicknames  " Crazy Bernie "  for Sanders and  " Sleepy Joe �  for Biden . 
  " I don't know ,  I think Crazy Bernie has it ,  "  he said . 
 As he left the White House on Friday afternoon ,  the president said of the Democratic contest :   � It � ll be very interesting to see what happens tomorrow . 
 �  Trump then referenced the Super Tuesday contests on March 3 ,  saying :   " On Tuesday ,  you have a very big day . 
 "  While en route to South Carolina ,  Trump tweeted an announcement that he is nominating Texas Rep . 
 John Ratcliffe to serve as Director of National Intelligence  ( DNI )  ,  months after the Republican lawmaker abruptly withdrew his name from consideration for the post . 
 Trump has held rallies in each of the four early voting states for the presidential nomination . 
 He went to Nevada last week ,  even though Republicans had canceled their presidential caucus to show allegiance to the president . 
 Likewise ,  South Carolina GOP officials opted not to hold a primary this year . 
 But that's not stopping Trump ,  who has reveled in poking his challengers in the run - up to their contests . 
  " Some people say I'm trolling the Democrats and maybe I am ,  "  Trump said at the White House . 
 Unlike the three earlier voting states ,  South Carolina is not considered a swing state . 
 Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by more than 14 percentage points there in 2016 . 
 Following Saturday's contest ,  more than a dozen states vote in the Super Tuesday contests . 
 Trump arrived in South Carolina following a brutal week for the stock market . 
 Stocks dropped another 357 points Friday ,  extending a rout that handed the market its worst week since October 2008 ,  at the height of the financial crisis . 
 Analysts worry that the stock swoon could cause consumer spending to contract . 
 Such spending makes up some 70 percent of the economy and has played a huge role in keeping the US . 
 economic expansion going . 
 Trump has linked his presidency to the markets through tweets and speeches ,  often taking credit for each new high in the indices . 
 Now ,  Trump is trying to reassure Americans that the economy is still strong while also theorizing that the Democratic candidates' debate performances have spooked investors . 
 The coronavirus virus has infected more than 84 , 000 people globally and caused more than 2 , 800 deaths . 
 COLUMBIA ,  SC . 
  �  Sen . Bernie Sanders is touting his electability  �  and is apparently cutting back on his campaign trail use of the word  " revolution . 
 "  The populist senator from Vermont  �  who is the current front - runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination  -  -  touted his electability in his last rally in South Carolina ahead of Saturday � s primary . 
 Sanders  �  as Fox News �  Andrew Craft highlights  -  -  urged the crowd at a rally at a park in downtown Columbia on Friday afternoon to  � take a look at the last 60 national polls that have been done ,  Bernie beats Trump 56 out of the 60 times . 
 Take a look at some of the polls in the battleground states like Pennsylvania ,  Wisconsin ,  Michigan ,  Bernie beats Trump . 
 �  Electability had long been former Vice President Joe Biden � s major selling point  �  that he was the strongest Democratic candidate to take on President Trump in November � s general election . 
 But as Sanders claimed a raw vote win in Iowa � s caucuses ,  rolled to an outright victory in New Hampshire � s primary ,  and routed his rivals in last weekend � s Nevada caucuses ,  his national poll numbers have soared and more and more Democrats are starting to see the independent senator as the strongest contender to take out Trump . 
 And Sanders did not say at Friday � s rally that he � s pushing for a political  � revolution ,  �  which has long been part of his stump speech . 
 Sanders also took aim twice on Friday at the president over Trump � s rally Friday evening in Charleston ,  SC . 
 It � s the third straight state where the president � s held a rally on the eve of a Democratic primary or caucus  �  following New Hampshire and Nevada . 
 Pointing to the worsening global coronavirus ,  Sanders argued that  � one might think that in the midst of a major health care crisis ,  the president of the United States would be assembling doctors and scientists and researchers . 
 Not Donald Trump . 
 He is here in South Carolina for one reason ,  to disrupt the democratic primary . 
 �   � He hopes that he can get a little media attention taking away from the Democratic candidates . 
 How petty ,  how pathetic is that ?  So I say to Donald Trump ,  don't worry about the Democratic primary cause we're gonna beat you . 
 Start worrying about the coronavirus and the health care crisis in America . 
 Do your job as president ,  �  Sanders added ,  taking a shot at the president . 
 While Democratic presidential candidates and Democratic lawmakers in Washington have criticized the president and his administration for downplaying the scope of the virus ,  the White House has defended Trump � s response to the global crisis . 
 Sanders departed South Carolina on Friday late afternoon for Massachusetts  �  one of the 14 states holding contests next week on Super Tuesday . 
 The Vermont senator is aiming to defeat fellow progressive champion and 2020 Democratic primary rival Sen . 
 Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on her own turn in Tuesday � s primary . 
 As the polls close in South Carolina on Saturday evening ,  Sanders will be in Virginia ,  which has the fifth - largest haul of delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday . 
 Overall ,  one - third of all the Democratic presidential nomination pledged delegates will be in play on Tuesday . 
 Sanders has been pouring a lot of his time and money the past couple of weeks into the Super Tuesday states . 
 In the runup to last weekend � s Nevada caucuses ,  Sanders campaigned in California and Texas  �  the two biggest Super Tuesday prizes . 
 And Thursday he campaigned in North Carolina  �  the third biggest state to hold a contest next week . 
 Steyer � s optimistic After poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire ,  Tom Steyer was hoping for a strong finish in Nevada . 
 The billionaire hedge fund manager turned environmental and progressive advocate spent a lot of money and time in the Silver State ,  but didn � t get much bang for his buck as he finished in the low single digits in last weekend � s caucuses . 
 But Steyer  �  who � s been heavily courting black voters  �  is optimistic things will be different in South Carolina . 
 A Real Clear Politics average the seven polls conducted this week of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the Palmetto State showed him in third place at 13 percent  �  behind Biden and Sanders . 
 Steyer told Fox News on Friday that  � we have a very good team here . 
 I � ve spent a lot of time on the ground and I � m talking straight forwardly about issues . 
 This is a heavily African - American state . 
 I talk very straight forwardly about race . 
 I � m the only person talking about reparations for slavery . 
 I think I � ve been here the most and looked most people in the eye and talked most straight forwardly and I think that � s why . 
 �  Asked how a solid finish in South Carolina will help him in the Super Tuesday states ,  Steyer emphasized :   � I think that � s a springboard for people to think that I can pull this party together ,  which is what I want . 
 �  Steyer and Biden are the only two Democratic candidates who will be in South Carolina when the polls close on Saturday night . 
 Biden � s South Carolina bounce ?  For Biden ,  a win in South Carolina is a necessity  �  coming after poor fourth and fifth places finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire followed by a distant second place finish to Sanders in Nevada . 
 But the former vice president feels he � s already getting a boost out of South Carolina heading into Super Tuesday . 
 Speaking with reporters  -  including Fox News �  Madeleine Rivera  �  after delivering a speech about gun reform outside of the Columbia barbershop Toliver � s Mane Event ,  Biden said he thinks he � s already got enough of boost from his time in South Carolina that will carry over into Tuesday � s coast to coast contests . 
 On Sunday ,  Biden will campaign in the Super Tuesday states of Alabama and Virginia . 
 At his stop in Norfolk ,  Biden will be joined by Sen . 
 Tim Kaine of Virginia . 
 The 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee on Friday endorsed Biden . 
 In a victory for President Trump ,  an appellate court ruled Friday that it wouldn't enforce a congressional subpoena to compel former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before House lawmakers . 
 The US court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2 - 1 that it doesn't have the authority to decide the case ,  essentially making congressional subpoenas to the White House invalid . 
 House Democrats had wanted McGahn to testify amid its investigation into whether Trump attempted to obstruct Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation . 
  " If we order McGahn to testify ,  what happens next ?  McGahn ,  compelled to appear ,  asserts executive privilege in response to the Committee � s questions ,  "  Judge Thomas Griffith ,  an appointee of President George W . 
 Bush ,  wrote in the opinion . 
  " The Committee finds those assertions baseless ,  "  he continued . 
  " In that case ,  the Committee assures us ,  it would come right back to court to make McGahn talk . 
 The walk from the Capitol to our courthouse is a short one ,  and if we resolve this case today ,  we can expect Congress � s lawyers to make the trip often . 
 "  The subpoena for McGahn to appear before lawmakers prompted a clash between the executive and legislative branches ,  with Trump claiming that he can block witnesses from talking to Congress . 
 The Justice Department argued that presidential advisers had  " absolute immunity "  from speaking to Congress . 
 The DOJ said it was pleased with the ruling ,  saying the court recognized  " that the House of Representatives cannot invoke the power of the courts in its political disputes with the Executive Branch . 
  " Suits like this one are without precedent in our Nation � s history and are inconsistent with the Constitution � s design . 
 The DC . 
 Circuit � s cogent opinion affirms this fundamental principle ,  "  the statement continued . 
 The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed McGahn on April 22 ,  but the White House blocked his appearance . 
 The obstruction probe coincided with an impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine . 
 He was impeached in the House and acquitted earlier this month in the Senate . 
 The House said it still wants to question McGahn about potential obstruction on Trump's part during the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election . 
 In Mueller's report ,  McGahn's name appears more than 150 times in reference to Trump's alleged attempts to hinder the investigation ,  Politico reported . 
 In the court's lone dissenting vote ,  Judge Judith Rogers said the court's refusal to enforce the subpoena stripped the House of impeachment powers since the request for his testimony came during the impeachment inquiry ,  the politics website reported . 
  � In the context of impeachment ,  when the accuracy and thoroughness of the investigation may well determine whether the President remains in office ,  the House � s need for information is at its zenith ,  �  wrote Rogers ,  a Bill Clinton appointee . 
 In a lawsuit filed the House Judiciary Committee over the summer ,  McGahn was called  " most important witness ,  other than the President ,  to the key events that are the focus of the Judiciary Committee � s investigation "  into Russian interference . 
 McGahn was a star witness in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report who  �  under Trump's orders  �  refused to release documents or testify before the panel . 
 The Democratic lawsuit challenged the White House rationale that McGahn and other witnesses can defy subpoenas . 
 The Trump administration has argued that ,  under executive immunity ,  Congress may not constitutionally compel senior presidential advisers to testify about their official duties . 
 By a 20 - point margin ,  voters say the Trump administration has mostly succeeded at stimulating the economy :  51 percent think that and 31 percent believe he has mostly failed . 
 In addition ,  by a 19 - point margin ,  more think the administration has mostly succeeded at creating jobs  ( 50 percent succeeded ,  31 percent failed )  . 
 These are two of nine national priorities the latest Fox News Poll asks voters about . 
 The findings indicate success in some areas ,  while others need improvement  -  -  including security . 
 The poll ,  released Friday ,  also finds more voters say they are better off than they were four years ago  ( 35 percent )  than worse off  ( 24 percent )  . 
 The largest number ,  however ,  feels their situation is about the same  ( 40 percent )  . 
 Nearly three times as many Republicans  ( 58 percent )  as Democrats  ( 19 percent )  say they are better off today . 
 The president � s worst rating is on unifying the country :  59 percent say Trump has mostly failed  ( 19 percent mostly succeeded )  . 
 Almost as many think he has mostly failed at improving race relations  ( 55 percent )  ,  and many say the same about improving health care  ( 50 percent failed )  . 
 Voters are less than wowed with the job Trump has done on his  � drain the swamp in Washington �  promise  -  -  48 percent call that a failure  ( 21 percent succeeded )  . 
 Views are more mixed on security issues . 
 On making the country safer ,  voters say the administration has mostly failed by 7 points  ( 38 succeeded ,  45 failed )  . 
 And despite the expansion of the US . - Mexico border wall ,  voters divide over whether Trump has been effective on his signature issue of border security  ( 40 succeeded ,  42 failed )  . 
 On handling the Islamic extremist group ISIS ,  voters split :  39 percent mostly succeeded vs .38 percent mostly failed . 
 For comparison ,  voters believed the Obama administration had mostly failed on many of these same priorities as his term started to wind down . 
 In January 2016 ,  majorities gave failing grades for stimulating the economy  ( 51 percent mostly failed )  ,  improving health care  ( 53 percent )  ,  making the country safer  ( 58 percent )  ,  improving race relations  ( 59 percent )  ,  and handling ISIS  ( 65 percent )  . 
 In general ,  47 percent of voters approve of Trump � s job performance and 52 percent disapprove . 
 That is a tad better than last month when it was 45 - 54 percent  ( January 2020 )  . 
 The president � s best rating continues to be 48 percent approve vs 47 percent disapprove in February 2017 ,  soon after his inauguration . 
 His record low was 38 percent approval in October 2017 . 
 Fully 89 percent of Republicans are happy with Trump � s performance . 
 And ,  his job approval stands at a record high of 14 percent among Democrats . 
 Overall ,  a majority of voters approve of how Trump � s handling the economy  ( 54 approve ,  42 disapprove )   -  -  yet a majority disapproves on health care  ( 38 approve ,  53 disapprove )  . 
 Poll Pourri  -  -  Most voters are at least somewhat confident the federal government is prepared to deal with the coronavirus  ( 74 percent )  . 
 A smaller majority feels confident US intelligence agencies are prepared to deal with the Russian government trying to interfere in the next presidential election  ( 68 percent )  . 
  -  -  On the Senate impeachment trial ,  voters approve of Trump � s acquittal  ( 50 - 44 percent )  . 
  -  -  Views split on Trump � s recent presidential pardons . 
 Forty - nine percent think they were an abuse of pardon power ,  while 43 percent call them  � fairly typical . 
 �  In February 2001 ,  55 percent said pardons by former President Clinton were an abuse of power and 32 percent said typical . 
  -  -  Voters remain unhappy with lawmakers in Washington :  26 percent approve of the job Congress is doing and 65 percent disapprove . 
  -  -  Nearly half of voters ,  49 percent ,  disapprove of Trump � s tweeting . 
 That � s more than double the 19 percent who approve . 
 Another 28 percent  � wish he � d be more cautious . 
 �  Conducted February 23 - 26 ,  2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research  ( D )  and Shaw  &  Company  ( R )  ,  this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1 , 000 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones . 
 The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for all registered voters . 
 President Trump on Friday said he is nominating Texas Rep . 
 John Ratcliffe to serve as Director of National Intelligence  ( DNI )  ,  months after the Republican congressman abruptly withdrew his name for the post . 
  � I am pleased to announce the nomination of  @ RepRatcliffe  ( Congressman John Ratcliffe )  to be Director of National Intelligence  ( DNI )  ,  "  the president tweeted . 
  " Would have completed process earlier ,  but John wanted to wait until after IG Report was finished . 
 John is an outstanding man of great talent !  "  Ratcliffe ,  a former federal prosecutor who had been a fierce defender of Trump and his agenda ,  was one of the most vocal critics of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller � s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election . 
 Ratcliffe will likely face a fierce confirmation battle as Democrats have argued he was selected due to his loyalty rather than experience . 
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement following Trump's announcement ,  saying :   � Intelligence should never be guided by partisanship or politics . 
 Unfortunately ,  Congressman Ratcliffe has shown an unacceptable embrace of conspiracy theories and a clear disrespect and distrust of our law enforcement and intelligence patriots that disqualify him from leading America � s intelligence community . 
 "   � Last summer ,  this nomination was withdrawn after revelations about Congressman Ratcliffe � s clear lack of qualifications and many misleading statements about his resume ,  "  she continued . 
  " The president is now ignoring these many serious outstanding concerns and letting politics ,  not patriotism ,  guide our national security . 
 "  Pelosi added :   � We call upon the Senate to remember that they take an oath to protect America ,  not the president ,  and vote against this nomination . 
 �   � With this nomination ,  President Trump has shown once again his lack of respect for the rule of law and the intelligence community . 
 Republicans must join Democrats in swiftly rejecting the nomination of Mr . 
 Ratcliffe ,  �  said New York Sen . 
 Chuck Schumer ,  the Senate Democratic leader . 
 He called Ratcliffe a  " highly partisan operative . 
 "  In August ,  Trump announced that Ratcliffe would be withdrawing as his nominee for director of national intelligence just days after announcing him as his pick ,  citing his tough treatment at the hands of  � the LameStream Media . 
 �  In a tweet at the time ,  Trump said that Ratcliffe ,  whom he tapped to replace Dan Coats ,  will stay in Congress . 
 But on Friday ,  he announced plans  -  -  again  -  -  to nominate Ratcliffe . 
 Richard Grenell ,  the US ambassador to Germany ,  was appointed last week by Trump to serve as acting DNI while Trump considered who he would nominate to take over the job more permanently . 
 Grenell is an outspoken Trump loyalist with a large conservative following on Twitter and also the first openly gay person to serve in a cabinet - level position . 
  " Congratulations ,   @ RepRatcliffe !  "  Grenell tweeted . 
  " We are ready for you and grateful for your willingness to serve . 
 "  Late last week it was reported that Trump was considering Rep . 
 Doug Collins ,  R - Ga . 
 ,  for the permanent Director of National Intelligence job ,  but Collins told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo that while he's humbled by the possible offer ,  he is focused on running for Senate and would not accept the job . 
 NATIONAL HARBOR ,  Md . 
  -  -  This week � s Conservative Political Action Conference made clear that Republicans have their political bogeyman for 2020  -  -  and it's the person who could possibly be the Democrats �  bona fide nominee . 
 The theme at the annual conservative gathering outside Washington has been  " America vs . 
 Socialism ,  "  and by extension ,  the rhetoric repeatedly turned back to the democratic socialist Sen . 
 Bernie Sanders . 
  " You don't feel the Bern  -  -  there's no 'berning' going on in here !  "  American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp ,  who presides over CPAC ,  joked to the audience on Friday . 
 The conservative narrative for the 2020 general election campaign was being set in plush surroundings at the Gaylord resort by the Potomac ,  on the outskirts of the capital . 
 Whether Sanders  -  -  the current Democratic presidential primary front - runner  �  becomes the party � s nominee or not ,  the big - government policies he represents are now what President Trump and his allies are running against . 
  � There is a tremendous opportunity ,  particularly with the likelihood of Bernie Sanders being on the ticket ,  we can � t take it for granted ,  �  former GOP Wisconsin Gov . 
 Scott Walker told Fox News . 
  � But if we get it right ,  we can move beyond just personality politics to a real difference between socialism and freedom . 
 That � s really the choice that voters have . 
 �  Speaker after speaker at CPAC described Republicans as waging a war on socialism and a campaign for freedom and democracy � as they began to make the case for a second term for Trump ,  who will close out the event with a speech Saturday . 
  " Socialism sucks ,  "  Trump campaign adviser Mercedes Schlapp said on Thursday ,  warning that Republicans must  � stop it in its tracks . 
 �  Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk told Fox News that Sanders' presidency is  " deathly serious . 
 "   � We dismiss his candidacy at our own peril ,  �  Kirk said . 
 Vice President Mike Pence said at CPAC on Thursday that  " Elections are about choices ,  �  while saying that the 2020 race will give voters the choice between socialism and freedom  � The choice has never been clearer ,  the stakes have never been higher ,  �  Pence said . 
  � Men and women of CPAC ,  we � ve got work to do . 
 The truth is ,  it won � t be enough to win the next election . 
 We � ve got to win the next generation . 
 �   � Freedom works . 
 Socialism doesn � t ,  �  he added . 
 House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy also boldly predicted that Democrats will lose the majority in the House of Representatives this cycle with Sanders at the top of the Democratic ticket . 
  � The Democrats have surrendered to the socialists ,  �  McCarthy told Fox News on the sidelines of CPAC . 
  � There is a reason why Bernie Sanders is going to become their nominee and that � s because this is no longer the Democratic Party  �  this is a socialist Democratic Party . 
 �   " The Democrats are going to nominate who they think best represents them ,  �  he said . 
  � And I think ,  as today � s socialist Democratic Party ,  Bernie is their person who represents them best . 
 �  Sanders ,  a self - described democratic socialist ,  is leading the Democratic presidential primary field in the delegate count and national polling ,  prompting warnings from party members and especially his nomination rivals that he could hurt the party down - ballot if nominated . 
 Asked what would happen if the Democratic Party attempted to take the Democratic nomination away from Sanders ,  I - Vt . ,  at the convention ,  Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel ,  during a panel at CPAC said :   � I don � t know how they can do it without creating a civil war in their party . 
 �  She added :   � But boy ,  isn � t it fun to watch ?  �  Sanders ,  though ,  argues that his message of government - funded health care for all and drastically expanded benefits covering education and more resonates with much of the country . 
 Sen . Elizabeth Warren ,  D - Mass . ,  too ,  argues that such a  " progressive "  message is widely popular while making the case that she's the better choice to accomplish it . 
 In the Democratic nomination race ,  Sanders is winning so far :  He lost the final delegate count in Iowa to Buttigieg but essentially tying the caucuses themselves ,  while winning in New Hampshire and Nevada . 
 He threatens to build a daunting delegate lead over his rivals should he be able to carry that momentum into South Carolina this weekend and Super Tuesday next week . 
 According to the latest RealClearPolitics average for the South Carolina primary ,  former Vice President Joe Biden is leading with double digits at 34.3 percent of the vote  �  after a lackluster performance in Iowa and New Hampshire ,  and a distant second - place finish in Nevada . 
 Sanders is currently polling in second place ,  with 22.3 percent . 
 The news site Axios is teasing an upcoming interview it conducted with former Trump adviser Roger Stone ,  but a source tells Fox News that Stone repeatedly rebuffed questions about his criminal case because of the court - imposed gag order against him . 
 On Friday ,  the site tweeted that its show Axios on HBO  � returns Sunday  �  with an interview with Roger Stone . 
 �  It posted a clip of Stone saying :   " The only fear I have is not being right with God . 
 "  But a source who was present for the interview stated the gag order was not violated ,  as Stone refused to answer questions about his case :   " It got testy . 
 "  This person said the interview was arranged to be about the parallels between the 1972 election and the 2020 election . 
 But the interviewer  � tried to sandbag �  Stone with questions about his case and trial ,  which he declined to answer ,  the source said . 
 Axios ,  though ,  denied that description of how the interview went . 
  � The characterization of the interview is incorrect ,  "  Axios spokeswoman Megan Swiatkowski said in an email . 
  " Watch the show at 6 pm . 
 ET / PT on March 1 on all HBO platforms . 
 �  Stone was sentenced to more than three years in prison last week . 
 Stone ,  a longtime adviser to Trump before he was elected president ,  was convicted in November on seven counts of obstruction ,  witness tampering and making false statements to Congress on charges that stemmed from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller � s investigation . 
 Stone has denied wrongdoing . 
 He remains under a gag order imposed by US . 
 District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson as she considers motions in his case . 
 Stone � s legal team has requested a new trial amid claims of bias being leveled against the jury forewoman ,  who it emerged had a history of Democratic Party activism and anti - Trump ,  left - wing social media posts . 
 There's been speculation that Trump could eventually pardon Stone . 
 HARRISBURG ,  Pa . 
  -  -  Some of the progressive Democrats running for president are hardening their stances on fracking and its potential impact on the environment ,  as the issue divides Democrats in key election states like Pennsylvania . 
 Fracking ,  short for hydraulic fracturing ,  is a drilling technique companies use to extract gas and oil from the ground . 
 In Pennsylvania ,  Democratic leaders see the future of fracking differently . 
  � I feel strongly that we need to move away from fossil fuel extraction . 
 We certainly need to move away from the practice of fracking ,  �  said State Rep . 
 Danielle Friel Otten ,  a Democrat who represents Chester County . 
 Otten fears fracking is a danger to the environment and a threat to public health and safety . 
 For the last three years ,  her suburban neighborhood outside Philadelphia has been a construction site for gas pipelines . 
  � I live in a community that � s been impacted by the downstream impacts of fracking ,  �  Otten said . 
 Pennsylvania � s Lt . Gov . 
 John Fetterman ,  a Democrat ,  has another view . 
  � I think there � s a place for these industries . 
 You know ,  we can � t all work for Google ,  �  said Fetterman . 
 When Fetterman is not working at the Capitol Building in Harrisburg ,  he � s home in Western Pennsylvania . 
  � I live directly across the street from ,  perhaps ,  the largest industrial site in Pennsylvania ,  �  said Fetterman . 
 Pennsylvania � s first unconventional well was drilled in Washington County in 2004 . 
 Since then ,  the western part of the state has become a hub for thousands of wells . 
 Fetterman says a ban on fracking would be premature and impact thousands of Pennsylvanians who work in the industry . 
  � I think it � s important that we transition away from fossil fuels in general ,  but I think just an arbitrary ,  day one kind of ban ,  I think ,  would create a lot of unintended consequences ,  �  said Fetterman . 
 In 2019 ,  President Trump visited western Pennsylvania twice to talk about his pro - industry policies . 
 Now ,  the debate over fracking is playing out on an even bigger political stage :  the presidential race . 
 Two progressives running  -  -  Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  -  -  have proposed bans on fracking ,  if elected . 
 It's something that frustrates David Spigelmyer ,  the president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition ,  which represents industry workers in western Pennsylvania . 
 According to the Institute for Energy Research ,  the Marcellus Shale is one of the largest natural gas reserves in North America . 
 It stretches from upstate New York through Pennsylvania to West Virginia and parts of Ohio . 
  � The natural gas industry has been an enormous job generator here in the commonwealth ,  �  said Spigelmyer . 
 According to Spigelmyer ,  a fracking ban would cost more than 600 , 000 Pennsylvanians their jobs . 
  � We know what it � s like to be dependent on foreign sources of oil . 
 We know what it � s like to have to send men and women in uniform abroad to protect the free flow supply of oil and if we eliminate hydraulic fracturing ,  we give up now an independent state of energy development in America ,  �  said Spigelmyer . 
 Political analysts think a presidential candidate's view on fracking could be a deciding factor in key states this year . 
  � It � s important ,  but we don � t really know how yet . 
 It depends on voter turnout and it depends on the strength of that coalition going into the election ,  �  said Jack Santucci ,  a political science professor at Drexel University . 
 A recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Cook Political Report shows 57 percent of undecided Pennsylvania voters think a fracking ban is a bad idea ,  compared with 39 percent who say it � s a good idea . 
  � It � s a tough issue for the party here to navigate . 
 You � re starting to see economic issues divide both parties a little bit . 
 Both parties are starting to negotiate internal divisions on economic issues ,  �  said Santucci . 
 In the midst of the debate over fracking ,  two natural gas pipelines are being considered in Pennsylvania and New Jersey . 
 President Trump announced Friday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will witness the signing of an agreement with the Taliban as part of an effort to bring thousands of US . troops home from the post - 9 / 11 Afghanistan war . 
  � Nearly 19 years ago ,  American service members went to Afghanistan to root out the terrorists responsible for the 9 / 11 attacks . 
 In that time ,  we have made great progress in Afghanistan ,  but at great cost to our brave service members ,  to the American taxpayers ,  and to the people of Afghanistan ,  �  Trump said in a statement . 
  � When I ran for office ,  I promised the American people I would begin to bring our troops home ,  and seek to end this war . 
 We are making substantial progress on that promise . 
 �  He said that Pompeo would witness the signing of the agreement ,  while Defense Secretary Mark Esper would issue a joint declaration with the country  � If the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan live up to these commitments ,  we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home ,  �  he said . 
 Trump did not say where the deal would be signed ,  but the Associated Press said it had previously been reported as occurring in Doha ,  Qatar . 
 Esper said this month that the deal  " looks very promising "  and could lead to American troops' withdrawal from Afghanistan . 
 Esper told reporters that the US troop levels could be reduced to about 8 , 600  -  -  from 12 , 000 currently in the country  -  -  if the seven - day truce is successful . 
 However ,  the Defense Department said counterterrorism operations will continue in the country . 
 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani hasn't spoken publicly about the agreement ,  but according to Esper ,  he is  " fully on board . 
 "   � He wants to lead his part of the process ,  which if we get to that would be a peace deal that would involve very soon afterward an inter - Afghan negotiation ,  "  Esper said . 
  " He wants to be clearly a full partner in that and wants to lead on that and make sure that all Afghans come together .

  �  South Carolina traditionally holds the first southern primary in the race for the White House . 
 And unlike New Hampshire  -  -  where only independents can choose the party primary they want to vote in  -  -  South Carolina holds an open primary . 
 That means anyone of any political affiliation or no affiliation at all can cast a ballot . 
 Since 1980 ,  the winner of the Republican primary in South Carolina has gone on to win the GOP presidential nomination  �  with one exception . 
 That was in 2012 ,  when eventual nominee Mitt Romney finished second behind former House Speaker Newt Gingrich . 
 For the Democrats ,  South Carolina also plays a very important role as a key indicator of the crucial African - American vote . 
 This cycle ,  black voters are expected to make up roughly 60 percent of the Democratic presidential primary electorate in the Palmetto State . 
 Here � s a look at the recent winners in South Carolina � s presidential primaries .

 -  -  Rep . Devin Nunes ,  R - Calif . ,  warned Friday that Republicans have subpoenas  � ready to go �  if they take back the majority of the House of Representatives in November ,  saying they plan to continue investigating and interviewing top FBI and Justice Department  ( DOJ )  officials involved in the Russia investigation . 
 In an interview with Fox News on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference  ( CPAC )  Friday ,  Nunes ,  the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee ,  said it was difficult for people to  � trust the FBI and DOJ �  after the bureau � s initial Russia probe and former Special Counsel Robert Mueller � s nearly two - year - long investigation . 
 That probe led to no evidence of a conspiracy or coordination between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election . 
  � You can be sure of this ,  if we take the House in November ,  we have subpoenas ready to go that will continue going after these dirty cops ,  �  Nunes told Fox News . 
 Nunes went on to bash Democrats ,  specifically Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep . 
 Adam Schiff ,  D - Calif . ,  for not taking action to make  � reforms �  to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  ( FISA )  process . 
  � What they � re trying to do is a cover - up  -  -  they � re trying to cover up the fact that their party was involved in the biggest political scandal in modern US history ,  where they fed disinformation ,  likely Russian disinformation from a campaign into the FBI and opened an investigation on the other campaign ,  �  Nunes said . 
  � They � re doing everything they can to not make reforms and that � s not going to be sufficient ,  �  he said . 
 Nunes and Republicans on the Intelligence Committee have been blasting Schiff and Democrats and accusing them of ignoring FISA abuse ,  following the release of a scathing Justice Department inspector general report that revealed significant misconduct . 
 Justice Department Inspector General  ( IG )  Michael Horowitz ,  in his Dec . 
 9 ,  2019 report ,  identified  � 17 serious shortcomings related to the conduct �  of the surveillance of former Trump campaign foreign policy aide Carter Page ,  and that the FBI made repeated errors and misrepresentations before the FISA court ,  as they sought to monitor Page in 2016 and 2017 . 
 Page was a central figure in Mueller � s investigation . 
 Mueller did not find any wrongdoing by Page and was unable to substantiate the anti - Trump dossier � s claims about him . 
 Horowitz � s report also confirmed that the FISA applications to monitor Page relied heavily on the now - infamous Trump dossier ,  authored by ex - British intelligence officer Christopher Steele ,  commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS ,  and funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton � s 2016 presidential campaign through law firm Perkins Coie . 
 Last month ,  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  ( FISC )  also released a newly declassified summary of a Justice Department assessment revealing at least two of the FBI � s surveillance applications to monitor Page lacked probable cause . 
 But for the time being ,  Nunes told Fox News that he and Republicans on the committee will continue to make recommendations to Democrats for reform to FISA . 
  � It is complicated to fix FISA ,  �  Nunes told Fox News . 
  � We � re going to give all of the information . 
 We have a lot of ideas ,  we want to see those ideas and give them sunlight ,  so we � re going to give those ideas to Democratic leadership and they can choose to negotiate with us or do nothing . 
 �  He added :   � At the end of the day ,  they � re in charge . 
 �  Religious intolerance comes in many forms and manifests in degrees large and small ,  but the left � s response to President Trump � s appointment of Vice President Mike Pence to lead the nation � s handling of the coronavirus is the latest serving of demagoguery against people of faith . 
 In announcing Mr . 
 Pence � s role ,  President Trump cited the vice president � s executive experience managing public health in Indiana ,  where he previously served as governor . 
  � He � s got a certain talent for this ,  �  Trump said . 
 Rep . Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez ,  D - NY . ,  a reliable critic of the administration and all things conservative ,  served up early objection ,  falsely stating ,   � Mike Pence literally does not believe in science . 
 It is utterly irresponsible to put him in charge of US coronavirus response as the world sits on the cusp of a pandemic . 
 �  The Democrat congresswoman is just wrong . 
 Of course ,  Mr . Pence believes in science and ,  in fact ,  his belief in science helps to inform his policy positions . 
 Other critics quickly pounced ,  blaming Pence for an HIV outbreak in the Hoosier state during his gubernatorial tenure . 
 At the time ,  there were those who favored a needle exchange program to combat the virus ,  suggesting such a plan would reduce the spread of infection . 
 Mr . Pence objected ,  stating ,   � I don � t believe effective anti - drug policy involves handing out drug paraphernalia . 
 �  To say an objection to handing out needles to drug dealers is anti - science is foolish in the extreme . 
 But opponents of Mr . Pence � s newly announced role to help combat the coronavirus are even raising objections that predate his time in Indiana � s governor � s mansion . 
 As a congressman in 2011 ,  Vice President Pence voted to cut funding to Planned Parenthood ,  a move that abortion advocates claim caused abortion clinics in Indiana to close ,  thus preventing women from receiving HIV screenings . 
 Such a dubious claim is impossible to verify ,  especially since Planned Parenthood isn � t the only facility to provide screening services . 
 ABC � s late - night comedian Jimmy Kimmel also piled on ,  sarcastically quipping ,   � Why is Mike Pence in charge ?  What is his plan to stop the virus ?  Abstinence ?  �  Others even criticized Mr . 
 Pence � s call for prayer during the HIV outbreak in Indiana . 
 At the root of all these scurrilous charges against Vice President Pence is a deep - seated religious intolerance and a sad desire to politicize a very serious situation . 
 It � s true that throughout his long and honorable career in public service ,  Mr . 
 Pence has allowed his faith to inform his perspective and shape his actions . 
 What � s interesting ,  though ,  is that the same people who criticize him for doing so raise no objections when people on the left do . 
 Prior to running for the presidency in 2008 ,  then - Senator Barack Obama famously declared :   � Secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square . 
 Frederick Douglas ,  Abraham Lincoln ,  Williams Jennings Bryant ,  Dorothy Day ,  Martin Luther King  -  indeed ,  the majority of great reformers in American history  -  were not only motivated by faith but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause . 
 So ,  to say that men and women should not inject their 'personal morality' into public policy debates is a practical absurdity . 
 Our law is by definition a codification of morality ,  much of it grounded in the Judeo - Christian tradition . 
 �  President Obama was widely applauded for correlating faith with public service  -  -  but now that a socially conservative person is in a position of governmental authority ,  his faith commitments are unallowable . 
 Do our friends on the left not see the glaring hypocrisy ?  President Trump has also been criticized for appointing Mr . 
 Pence to lead up the virus response because the vice president doesn � t have medical credentials . 
 Never mind that Mr . 
 Pence immediately tapped Debbie Birx ,  a world - renowned expert on infectious disease . 
 Not only do people of faith and those with deeply held - religious convictions deserve a seat at the table  -  -  but I would argue they � re very often the most qualified and most appropriate people to hold such roles . 
 That � s because in the history of global pandemics and other health emergencies ,  it � s very often been people of faith who have sacrificially and competently served in humanitarian relief roles . 
 Like Vice President Pence ,  their faith commands them to rush in when everyone else is inclined to run out . 
 It would be good and appropriate for all people of faith to pray for the vice president as he steps into this critical role . 
 He is a good man who loves our country and ,  regardless of where you are on the political spectrum ,  he deserves our support for this assignment . 
 May we be one country with one voice ,  praying for containment of this deadly virus ,  even invoking the words of Jesus Himself who said ,   � Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid . 
 �  UFC President Dana White isn � t losing any sleep over the possibility that his friendship with President Donald Trump could cost him his fanbase . 
 White spoke with TMZ Sports on Friday ,  just one week after he appeared at a Trump rally in Colorado Springs ,  which he said wasn � t a planned speaking engagement . 
  � He called me and asked me if I wanted to go to Colorado  . 
 So we flew over to Colorado for the day and back to Vegas ,  �  White told TMZ . 
  � We were just hanging out ,  talkin �  fights . 
 I wasn � t even supposed to speak that day . 
 I was just cruising over there with him . 
 �  Trump  � called me up ,  �  said White . 
 He called it an  � incredible �  experience flying on Air Force One with Trump ,  who he said has been a friend for 20 years . 
 When asked if he was worried that his friendship with Trump would result in losing fans ,  White said  � I don � t give a s -  -  -  . 
 �   � I can � t say it enough . 
 This guy ,  and when I say this guy I � m talking about President Trump ,  is such a good friend and such a loyal ,  amazing guy ,  man . 
 He � s a great guy . 
 He � s been a friend of mine for a long time . 
 He continued :   � If you don � t like me because I � m friends with this guy ,  that � s your problem ,  not mine . 
 �  The US State Department extended an olive branch to Iran Friday amid a report that more than 200 people in the country have reportedly been killed by the coronavirus ,  a figure six times higher than the officially released number . 
  " The United States stands with the people of Iran during the public health crisis caused by the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus  ( COVID - 19 )  . 
 The US Government is prepared to assist the Iranian people in their response efforts ,  "  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement . 
  " This offer of support to the Iranian people ,  which has been formally conveyed to Iran through the Government of Switzerland ,  underscores our ongoing commitment to address health crises and prevent the spread of infectious diseases . 
 Supporting the Iranian people is and will remain among our top priorities . 
 "  Pompeo is also calling on Tehran to  " cooperate fully and transparently with international aid and health organizations ,  "  amid growing international concern that Tehran's leadership is purporting to coverup the extent of the problem and lacks the resources necessary to contain the spread of the illness . 
 Iranian government officials have said that the death toll in the country is 34 . 
 But a report by BBC Persia ,  citing sources in the country's health system ,  claims that number is at least 210 ,  with the vast portion of the victims residing in the capital Tehran and the holy city of Qom ,  which is where the first case was recorded last week . 
 Among those known to have contracted Covid - 19  �  according to state media  �  include Masoumeh Ebtekar ,  the highest - ranking woman in the Iranian government and the vice president for women and family affairs who also served as the spokesperson for the Iranian students who seized US hostages in 1979 ,  and two members of parliament ,  including the deputy health minister . 
 Modest measures have been taken to squash further spread  �  Friday prayers were called off in the capital and 22 other cities ,  and schools and universities have been shuttered . 
 While Tehran has vowed that they are being transparent in the handling of the virus ,  skepticism pervades . 
  "  ( Coronavirus )  came unseen and undetected into Iran ,  so the extent of infection may be broader than what we may be seeing ,  "  Dr . 
 Mike Ryan ,  executive director of the World Health Organization's emergencies program ,  stated Thursday . 
 NATIONAL HARBOR ,  Md . 
 -  -  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mocked his predecessor John Kerry on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference for what he described as his  � fancy dinners �  and  � cocktails �  in European destinations during the Obama administration . 
  � You should know that different secretaries kind of roll different ,  �  Pompeo told the audience at CPAC Friday . 
  � I � m not in it for the fancy dinners in Paris or Vienna  �  one of my predecessors went 62 times . 
 �  He added :   � That ,  my friends ,  is a lot of cocktails . 
 �   � He also went to Antarctica ,  �  Pompeo continued ,  joking :   � I don � t know who he was meeting there . 
 �  Kerry ,  who was secretary of state under former President Barack Obama's second term ,  was the highest - ranking US official ever to travel to Antarctica . 
  � I � d rather be with my team in tough places ,  �  Pompeo said ,  noting that he � s traveled around the world and  � spent significant and necessary time with evil individuals who have American blood on their hands . 
 �  He added :   � But I � ve also held and hugged children in every corner of the world . 
 They know America under President Trump is a force for good . 
 �   � It does not mean we get it right every day ,  but I can assure you ,  wherever I go ,  working for President Trump ,  people tug on my sleeve � they want to meet me ,  not because I � m Mike from Kansas ,  but because I represent the greatest nation  [ in the world ]  ,  �  he said . 
 Pompeo went on to tout the Trump administration � s moves in pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord ,  the killings of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi last year and Iran's Qassem Soleimani ,  and the administration � s success in bringing US hostages home . 
  � President Trump and I set a few overarching principles about the things we need to do in the world and the things we do not ,  �  he explained ,  noting the most  � obvious �  but most important was to  � keep America safe �  and to  � advance American values . 
 �   � That includes defending that first freedom � religious liberty ,  �  Pompeo said . 
  � We are safer than ever ,  our economy is more prosperous than ever and President Trump will not stop winning . 
 �  As the nation gears for battle against coronavirus ,  our biggest enemy is false information . 
 A lot of that is coming from the same place as the virus  -  -  China . 
 Government officials there have deceived and equivocated about how the disease got started . 
 China has been blaming the new virus on the sale of live exotic animals like bats at an outdoor food market in the city of Wuhan ,  claiming that � s where the earliest cases originated . 
 But new research in the medical journal Lancet proves that the first victims of coronavirus had no contact with that food market ,  contrary to the official story . 
 One possibility is that the virus leaked from China � s National Bio - Safety Laboratory ,  also in Wuhan ,  which handles some of the world � s most dangerous pathogens . 
 If the US is going to develop medications and vaccines against this coronavirus  �  now dubbed COVID - 19  �  our scientists need the truth . 
 The next source of misinformation is from our own Democratic politicians . 
 Sens Chuck Schumer ,  D - NY . ,  and Elizabeth Warren ,  D - Mass . ,  are accusing the Trump administration of having  � no plan . 
 �  That � s a blatant lie . 
 Trump officials from the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services have been briefing the public daily ,  as they fine - tune their response to this rapidly evolving global virus . 
 So Senators ,  just go to cdc . 
gov to read the 52 - page plan and stop whining . 
 Trump � s initial response ,  back on Jan . 
 31 ,  was to bar foreign travelers recently in China and quarantine or monitor American travelers returning from China . 
 Presidential aspirant former Vice President Joe Biden bashed Trump � s travel restrictions as  � reactionary ,  �  but truth is ,  they worked . 
 You can � t fight a virus with political correctness . 
 So far the US has been more successful than open - border European countries in minimizing the impact on local residents . 
 Trump � s travel restrictions slowed the arrival of the virus ,  sparing our hospitals from a sudden surge of patients sick with an unrecognizable disease . 
 Those travel restrictions also bought the US time to develop a diagnostic test ,  alert hospitals and adapt its longstanding pandemic flu plan to the specific features of coronavirus . 
 As President Trump has pointed out ,  seasonal flu sickens tens of millions of Americans each year and kills tens of thousands ,  while the US has identified only a handful of locally spread coronavirus cases and no deaths at all . 
 But there � s a reason his health officials are responding seriously to this novel virus . 
 It spreads faster than flu and is over forty times as deadly ,  with a mortality rate of 2.3 percent compared with the flu � s 0.05 percent . 
 It is also harder to contain because infected people can spread it even when they have no symptoms themselves . 
 No one knows whether this virus will spread here or fizzle out . 
 In an alarming statement on Tuesday ,  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention � s Nancy Messonnier cautioned the public to prepare for  � significant disruption of our lives �  if the virus spreads . 
 She laid out what governments at all levels would do . 
 The broad contours are first ,  preparing hospitals and doctors to treat infected patients and identifying their contacts who may also be infected . 
 Secondly ,  closing schools  ( which Japanese officials did this week )  and encouraging people to stay home . 
 School closures helped stopped the spread of H1N1 flu here and in Canada and Mexico in 2009 . 
 Thirdly ,  disinfecting public spaces . 
 Think subways ,  busses ,  arenas and airports . 
 As of Friday ,  Messonnier reminded the public that the risk to Americans remains  � really low . 
 �  Even so ,  to reduce that risk and raise public confidence ,  the federal government should take three steps now ,  without waiting to see if the virus explodes here . 
 Install hand hygiene dispensers in every airport jetway and check - in area Travelers carrying the virus still pose the biggest risk to the US . ,  despite some signs of local spread . 
 Coughing and sneezing spray viral droplets but they only reach six feet . 
 More significant is the risk of touching a surface after an infected person � s contaminated hands have touched it . 
 The virus can live on hard surfaces such as check - in touch screens and railings for as long as 9 days . 
 MIT researchers estimate that improving travelers �  hand cleanliness by installing the airport dispensers could reduce viral spread by double digits . 
 Don � t let this crisis go to waste Congress and the Food and Drug Administration should act now to remedy our dangerous over - reliance on China for the raw materials used in antibiotics ,  lung and breast cancer drugs ,  anti - virals such as Tamiflu and blood thinners . 
 What � s needed are tax and regulatory incentives to push pharmaceutical companies to bring their supply chain home . 
 America wouldn � t rely on China to manufacture our fighter planes and tanks . 
 Depending on China to stock our medicine chests and keep us alive is just as crazy . 
 Conduct infection - control drills in hospitals across the country Rigorous training is needed to stop the virus from sweeping through hospitals and infecting nurses and doctors ,  as well as patients there for other medical problems . 
 When an earlier coronavirus  �  SARS  �  struck Ontario ,  Canada in 2003 ,  a staggering 77 percent of people infected contracted it in the hospital because of lax infection control . 
 That mistake should not be repeated . 
 History shows that during viral outbreaks like this one ,  a hospital is the most dangerous place to be . 
 Practical advice  �  don � t go to an emergency room unless it � s a real emergency . 
 That � s where people unknowingly infected with coronavirus are likely to seek help . 
 You don � t want to be waiting next to them . 
 Democratic Rep . Adam Schiff ,  who led the impeachment fight against President Trump ,  said Friday he has  " profound concerns "  about Trump's response to the coronavirus and cast doubt on whether the White House is telling the truth to the American public about the global outbreak . 
  " The president and vice president don � t inspire confidence ,  "  Schiff told Fox News as he left a coronavirus briefing at the Capitol Friday morning . 
  " And because the president has made so many false statements about so many things ,  you can't really rely on the White House . 
 "  Schiff's comments come after Trump blasted Democrats in a tweetstorm overnight for playing politics with the coronavirus threat . 
 All House members were invited to attend an unclassified briefing with government health and safety officials Friday to address the latest developments and response to the viral outbreak that started in China and has infected more than 80 , 000 people worldwide . 
 Schiff said he found the briefing with career officials  " helpful "  but amped up the political fight with the White House over Trump's response . 
  " I have profound concerns about the management of this at the level of the White House ,  "  Schiff said ,   " but there are some good career people who we got the opportunity to talk to today . 
 �  One of the briefers was Dr . 
 Anthony Fauci ,  the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . 
 The White House reportedly instructed Fauci not to speak up about the outbreak without prior clearance ,  The New York Times reported . 
 Fauci was asked at the briefing whether he was being muzzled and the top doc denied it ,  according to several members . 
  � I am not being muzzled ,  �  Fauci told House members ,  according to Rep . 
 Mark Takano ,  D - Calif . 
 But Fauci said that the administration asked him to cease media appearances until they learned more about what is going on . 
 Schiff stressed the importance of professionals speaking up ,  even if it's in contrast to the president's rosy scenario . 
  " Thankfully ,  we do have good career people at the agencies and we're going to rely on them to be candid with us and  [ we ]  have to make sure that they feel comfortable speaking truth to power in an environment in which the administration does  [ try ]  to shut down any voice that's inconsistent with their preferred narrative ,  "  Schiff said . 
 The all - member unclassified briefing got off to a rocky start . 
 Many members had trouble getting into the room in the Capitol because it was too crowded and a number of Republicans were spotted jetting out after finding the room too full . 
 Rep . Paul Mitchell ,  R - Mich . ,  said he was leaving because Democratic Rep . 
 Rosa DeLauro ,  chair of the appropriations subcommittee that handles health funding ,  was making a partisan opening statement rather than allowing the briefers to speak . 
 Eventually ,  the meeting moved to a larger room in the Capitol Visitor Center which seemed to quell some concerns . 
  " The maddening thing is how  [ coronavirus ]  has been made into a partisan football the last few days . 
 And even today before this meeting got off the ground ,  some of them got up and left ,  �  Rep . 
 Doug LaMalfa ,  R - Calif . ,  said after the meeting . 
 Several members interviewed by Fox News said ,  in the end ,  the briefing was serious and helpful in getting the latest information ,  including the best number for their constituents to call with coronavirus concerns  -  -   ( 800 )  232 - 4636 ,  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention information line . 
 But many said they were still left with questions on the response and requested further briefings . 
  � I'm concerned ,  �  said Rep . 
 Stephen Lynch ,  D - Mass . 
 ,  who called for a better understanding of the best -  and worst - case scenario models of the outbreak so the government can better respond . 
 Lynch said he doesn't think Trump has a plan but finds comfort in veteran professionals throughout the national health system . 
  � I think they are internally trying to work up a response ,  but it is at odds with the president � s pronouncement that everything is OK and we � re doing a fantastic job ,  �  Lynch said . 
 Rep . Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez ,  D - NY . ,  hit Trump's choice of Vice President Pence to lead the coronavirus response team . 
  � Like I said before ,  he doesn � t believe in science . 
 And the fact that we have a non - physician vetting the response is a concern ,  "  Ocasio - Cortez said . 
 Rep . Rashida Tlaib ,  D - Mich . 
 ,  said constituents have been contacting her office with concerns about coronavirus ,  ranging from pregnant moms wondering how to protect their babies to constituents wondering where to go for testing . 
 One issue that Tlaib said she's tackling is why face masks aren � t provided for workers at Detroit Metropolitan Airport ,  which is one of the 11 airports designated by the Department of Homeland Security to accept incoming flights from China for coronavirus screening . 
  � It � s not even a lack of resources ,  possibly ,  but it � s also incompetence ,  �  Tlaib said after the briefing . 
  � Now I have somebody � s card so I � m going to follow up on why are there no masks at Detroit Metro  [ Airport ]  . 
 �  A federal appeals court on Friday slapped a temporary halt on the Remain - in - Mexico policy  -  -  one of the most effective Trump administration policies in halting last year � s migrant crisis  -  -  dealing a significant blow to the administration's efforts to control the flow of migrants claiming asylum at the southern border . 
 The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled in a 2 - 1 vote to put a hold on the policy  -  -  formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols  ( MPP )  . 
 In a separate ruling Friday ,  the same court also blocked an administration policy that prevents immigrants who crossed the border illegally from then claiming asylum in the US . 
 The policy ,  which was established in January and expanded over the summer amid greater cooperation with Mexico ,  returns migrants to Mexico as they await their hearings ,  with courtrooms set up at key border points in places such as Laredo and Brownsville ,  Texas . 
 Approximately 57 , 000 people have been returned to Mexico under the policy . 
 The policy essentially ended the process known as  � catch - and - release �  by which migrants were released into the interior ,  sometimes for years ,  until their cases were processed . 
 While critics said MPP was cruel and placed migrants in danger of violence by returning them to the country ,  it was identified as ending a key  � pull factor �  in why migrants were flooding the border  -  -  namely that they would be allowed into the interior of the US if they reached the border . 
 Officials said the process meant that cases could be heard in as little as 40 - 60 days ,  as opposed to the years it sometimes takes after family units are released into the US . 
 Those in favor of the program said that works better for the migrants ,  as it leaves them in limbo for less time ,  while also acting as a disincentive for Central American migrants who do not have legitimate asylum claims but might otherwise get into the US . 
 by claiming  � credible fear �  of returning home . 
 Since MPP was expanded ,  there has been a dramatic drop in migrants coming to the border from the high of April where 144 , 000 migrants reached the border . 
 Officials have repeatedly said the policy ,  along with other international agreements with Central American countries ,  has been a significant factor in that reduction . 
  � The importance of MPP can � t be stated enough ,  it is what � s allowed us to take control of the crisis that we saw in April and May . 
 The idea is to make sure we process individuals in a timely manner but make sure they wait south of the border ,  �  Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf told Fox News in November . 
 Wolf warned then that a ruling by the Ninth Circuit could have a dire effect on the US . 
 effort to regain control of its southern border ,  and hurt efforts of law enforcement on the ground trying to enforce the law . 
  � So you get an adverse ruling on MPP and it � s going to make the job of the men and women of Border Patrol as well as  [ Customs and Border Protection ]  and  [ Immigration and Customs Enforcement ]   .  
 very difficult for them ,  so it really can � t be overstated how much the program means to the department in controlling the crisis ,  �  he said . 
 But the policy has also been significantly controversial . 
 Liberal civil rights groups have called the policy  " secretive "  and part of an attack on legitimate asylum claims . 
 Multiple 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have promised to end the policy if elected to the White House . 
 The court sided with arguments from pro - immigration and liberal groups that the government has not done enough to ensure migrants are not returned to somewhere they may face persecution . 
 It accepted the claim that  " non - Mexicans returned to Mexico under the MPP risk substantial harm ,  even death ,  while they await adjudication of their applications for asylum . 
 "   � The court forcefully rejected the Trump administration � s assertion that it could strand asylum seekers in Mexico and subject them to grave danger ,  "  American Civil Liberties Union attorney Judy Rabinovitz ,  who argued the appeal ,  said in reaction to the ruling . 
  " It � s time for the administration to follow the law and stop putting asylum seekers in harm � s way . 
 �  It is far from clear what happens next . 
 The administration may request an  � en banc �  review of the decision by all of the judges of the Ninth Circuit in the coming weeks ,  or possibly try to take the case to the Supreme Court ,  where it has seen significant success in recent months on a number of immigration - related issues . 
 It is also unclear what will happen if those waiting at the border will be let in . 
 Groups advocating for a tough line on illegal immigration reacted to the ruling by noting the court � s traditional liberal bent  -  -  although President Trump has started to tilt the balance of the bench . 
  � The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly engaged in torturous interpretations of immigration law in order to elevate the interests of foreign nationals over those of US . 
 citizens ,  �  RJ Hauman ,  government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform  ( FAIR )  ,  told Fox News Friday . 
 The Trump administration on Friday announced it has formed a new committee as part of a response to the coronavirus outbreak  -  -  as part of an effort to quickly assess and respond to the outbreak and to better inform decision making about public health crises . 
  � We are creating a direct line to the nation � s top scientific minds on public health . 
 With the complexities of assessing and responding to emerging infectious diseases ,  a standing committee will build on the great work being done by the Trump Administration to rapidly engage with experts from the private sector ,  non - governmental organizations ,  the academic community ,  and relevant stakeholders from the broader science community ,  �  White House Office of Science and Technology Policy  ( OSTP )  Director Dr . 
 Kelvin Droegemeier said in a statement . 
  � This committee is a critical tool for examining emerging infectious diseases ,  like the COVID - 19 outbreak ,  and providing expedited ,  strategic input to policy making processes ,  �  he said . 
 The Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats is being set up by the OSTP and the National Academy of Sciences ,  to respond on short notice to federal requests to assess policy implications related to an infectious disease or health threat . 
 It is being eyed as a way to serve as a focal point for policy discussions with experts and to combat misinformation about health threats . 
  � COVID - 19 is the sort of international health threat that creates a climate ripe for misinformation ,  rumors ,  and panic ,  all of which can lead to poor decisions . 
 The National Academies stand ready to provide evidence - based advice to protect US citizens in a timely and expedited manner ,  �  said Dr . 
 Marcia McNutt ,  the president of the National Academy of Sciences . 
 The commission � s establishment comes as the US ,  along with other governments across the world ,  is ramping up its response to the virus as it threatens the global economy and as the number of cases hits 83 , 000 worldwide . 
 The coronavirus has not yet hit the US as hard as it has hit many Asian countries ,  though US authorities recently confirmed the first American coronavirus case that had no link to international travel in California ,  indicating the disease is now spreading in at least one American community . 
 Other areas of the country are also currently testing suspected cases of coronavirus . 
 China ,  the country hardest hit ,  has seen lower numbers of new infections ,  with 327 additional cases reported Friday ,  bringing the country's total to 78 , 824 . 
 Another 44 people died there for a total of 2 , 788 . 
 South Korea has recorded 2 , 337 cases while Iran has had 34 deaths and 388 cases . 
 Italy ,  France and Germany were also seeing increases ,  with dozens of infections . 
 The Trump administration has taken a number of measures ,  including placing travel restrictions on foreign nationals who have been in China in the last 14 days and implementing screening at ports of entry . 
 On Wednesday ,  President Trump held a press conference in which he said the government was ready to adapt and  � do whatever we have to as the disease spreads ,  if it spreads . 
 �   " But we � re very ,  very ready for this ,  for anything  -  -  whether it � s going to be a breakout of larger proportions or whether or not we � re  -  -  you know ,  we � re at that very low level ,  and we want to keep it that way ,  "  he told reporters . 
 Trump has also requested  $ 2 . 
5 billion in funding from Congress for the coronavirus response  -  -  a move quickly panned by Democratic congressional leaders as insufficient . 
  " For almost two years ,  the Trump Administration has left critical positions in charge of managing pandemics at the National Security Council and the Department of Homeland Security vacant . 
 His most recent budget called for slashing funding for the Centers for Disease Control ,  which is on the frontlines of this emergency ,  "  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said . 
  " Weeks after the Trump Budget called for slashing the CDC budget during this coronavirus epidemic ,  this undersized funding request shows an ongoing failure to understand urgent public health needs . 
 "  Trump responded Friday by accusing Democrats of trying to politicize the crisis and blame him . 
  � So ,  the Coronavirus ,  which started in China and spread to various countries throughout the world ,  but very slowly in the US because President Trump closed our border ,  and ended flights ,  VERY EARLY ,  is now being blamed ,  by the Do Nothing Democrats ,  to be the fault of  � Trump ,  �  �  he tweeted . 
 NATIONAL HARBOR ,  Md . 
 � Former Republican Wisconsin Gov . 
 Scott Walker ,  on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference Friday ,  opened the door to mounting a second presidential bid  -  -  either four or eight years from now . 
 Walker ,  in an interview with Fox News at CPAC ,  said he � ll spend the next four years on the  � front lines ,  �  working with young people to stress  � the importance of freedom over socialism . 
 "   � I � m 22 years younger than President Trump ,  so ,  I figured I have some breathing room ,  �  Walker told Fox News . 
 When asked whether he would run for president again ,  he said :   � Never say never � I don � t know about 2024 ,  but 2028 � yeah ,  at some point . 
 I � ve got plenty of time . 
 �  Walker ,  52 ,  ran for the nomination in the crowded Republican primary field in 2016 ,  against Trump and others . 
 Walker was the second to drop out of that race ,  complaining about  � personal attacks �  and warning the party at the time to counter Trump . 
  " I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive ,  conservative message can rise to the top of the field ,  "  Walker said in 2015 . "  . 
 I encourage other Republican presidential candidates to consider doing the same so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive ,  conservative alternative to the current front - runner . 
 "  Walker now defends Trump's policies and predicts ,   " We'll be in good shape in the 2020 election . 
 "   � There is a tremendous opportunity ,  particularly with the likelihood of Bernie Sanders being on the ticket ,  we can � t take it for granted ,  �  Walker told Fox News on Friday . 
  � But if we get it right ,  we can move beyond just personality politics to a real difference between socialism and freedom . 
 That � s really the choice that voters have . 
 �  Walker is currently the president of Young America � s Foundation ,  a group whose mission is to ensure  " young Americans understand and are inspired by the ideas of individual freedom ,  a strong national defense ,  free enterprise ,  and traditional values .
